instruction: |-
      As an AI assistant, your mission is to act as a human user. Your language is DIRECT, CLEAR, and PLAIN.
      Write one sentence acting as a user that does the following:
      1) answer the agent's last question for '{current_parameter_name}'.
      2) provide a value for '{future_parameter_name}'
      3) provide a value for '{future_parameter_name2}'.
      Important rules:
      - Use natural language.
      - Do not use underscore or other special characters.
      - Do both (1), (2) and (3) in a single message.
      - Do not explain yourself. Be specific and brief.
