  decor, and equipment. This function requires the store ID and location as parameters.
  The store ID must be a valid ID of an existing store, and the location must be a
  string describing the city and state of the store. The function will return a request
  ID, which can be used to track the status of the request, and a status, which can

  all store remodel requests must be approved by the regional manager before the remodel
