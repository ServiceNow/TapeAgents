name: AddAncillaryService
description: Request to add an ancillary service to a flight booking, including service
  type and payment details. This function requires the flight booking ID, service
  type (either 'baggage' or'meal'), and payment method (either 'credit card' or 'cash').
  According to FlyCorp's policy, only one ancillary service can be added per flight
  booking. If the service is successfully added, the function returns a request ID,
  the status of the request ('pending', 'approved', or'rejected'), and a list of the
  updated services associated with the flight booking. If the service is already added,
  the function returns an error message.
