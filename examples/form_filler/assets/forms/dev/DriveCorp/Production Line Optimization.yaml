name: Production Line Optimization
description: Request optimization of production lines to increase efficiency and reduce
  costs at DriveCorp. This function takes in the production line ID, current production
  capacity, and target production capacity as inputs. The function will analyze the
  production line's current configuration and provide recommendations for optimization.
  According to DriveCorp's policy, all production line optimizations must adhere to
  the company's safety and quality standards. The function will return a request ID,
  the status of the request (either 'pending', 'in_progress', or 'completed'), and
  a list of recommended changes to the production line configuration. If the request
  is approved, the function will also return the new production line ID and a comment
  explaining the changes made.
