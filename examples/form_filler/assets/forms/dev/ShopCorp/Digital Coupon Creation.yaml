description: Request the creation of a digital coupon for a specific product or promotion,
  including details on the coupon terms, expiration date, and target audience. This
  function requires the product ID, promotion type, coupon value, expiration date,
  and target audience as input parameters. The target audience can be either 'all
  customers' or 'loyalty program members'. The function will return a request ID,
  the status of the request (either 'pending', 'approved', or'rejected'), and a list
  of coupon codes generated for the promotion. According to ShopCorp's policies, digital
  coupons can only be created for products that are currently in stock and have a
