      Write a concise multi-step plan explaining which steps should be performed to find the answer for the given task.
      Remember that you can use web search, browser, python code execution and access the youtube videos to reach your goals.
      Be specific about how each step should be performed. Only describe the intended actions here, do not perform them yet.
      Consider that next steps may depend on results of previous steps, so include conditional branching using "if" statements where needed.

      Before we begin executing the plan, please answer the following pre-survey.
      Here is the pre-survey:
          1. Please list any specific facts or figures that are GIVEN in the request itself. It is possible that there are none.
          2. Please list any facts that may need to be looked up, and WHERE SPECIFICALLY they might be found. In some cases, authoritative sources are mentioned in the request itself.
          3. Please list any facts that may need to be derived (e.g., via logical deduction, simulation, or computation)
          4. Please list any facts that are recalled from memory, hunches, well-reasoned guesses, etc.
      When answering this survey, keep in mind that "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, statistics, etc.
