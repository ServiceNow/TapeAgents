Express your answer in base 9.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo find the product of $218_9 \\cdot 5_9$, we'll perform the multiplication step by step.\n\n1. First, we multiply $5_9$ with the units digit of the multiplicand ($8_9$). This will give us $40_{10} = 44_9$ (since in base 9, 5 * 8 = 44 in base 9).\n\n2. We write this result below the corresponding digit in the multiplicand and carry over the 4.\n\n3. Next, we multiply $5_9$ with the next digit of the multiplicand ($1_9$) and add the carried over 4. This gives us $(5_9 * 1_9) + 4_9 = 9_{10} = 10_9$ (since in base 9, 5 * 1 + 4 = 9, and we have to carry over 1).\n\n4. We write this result below the corresponding digit in the multiplicand and carry over the 1.\n\n5. Finally, we multiply $5_9$ with the leftmost digit of the multiplicand ($2_9$) and add the carried over 1. This gives us $(5_9 * 2_9) + 1_9 = 13_{10} = 15_9$.\n\n6. Now, we add up the results from each step: \n   $15_9$\n  $+44_9$\n  $+10_9$\n  $------\n  $69_9$\n\nTherefore, the product of $218_9 \\cdot 5_9$ is $\\boxed{690_9}$.<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":989,"reward":0.0,"logprobs":[-0.0006173135479912162,-0.05724245309829712,-1.311301275563892e-6,0.0,-0.0014293702552095056,-0.00020859450160060078,0.0,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-0.06622693687677383,-9.059865078597795e-6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.2943403720855713,-0.001958953682333231,-1.5133228302001953,-0.7135328054428101,-0.473606139421463,-0.00011634149996098131,-0.26912179589271545,-0.002737348433583975,0.0,-0.7556520104408264,-1.7770237922668457,-0.000034689302992774174,-2.063232898712158,-5.602820692729438e-6,-0.27506911754608154,-0.2731233835220337,-0.3406673073768616,-0.7931586503982544,-0.0006566275842487812,0.0,-0.00015793983766343445,-1.6467487812042236,-0.4432832598686218,-0.8058933615684509,-0.46182185411453247,-0.8047422170639038,-1.942507028579712,-0.7167642116546631,-7.152555099310121e-7,-1.8191473484039307,-0.02853003703057766,-0.0002768848498817533,0.0,-0.000048874615458771586,-2.0869131088256836,-2.069570541381836,-2.7795395851135254,-0.17468036711215973,-0.0019757291302084923,-0.4106679856777191,-0.2539339065551758,-1.1214545965194702,-0.005694832187145948,-2.256042242050171,-1.1462424993515015,-0.07878673821687698,-0.0012966329231858253,-0.00033480284037068486,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.0915493443608284,-0.455905556678772,-0.6939263939857483,-6.8742523193359375,-0.0005838358192704618,-0.002075662137940526,-0.00327313132584095,-0.007096561137586832,-1.3896925449371338,-2.007028579711914,-0.6426090598106384,-0.00008022463589441031,-0.00007617183291586116,-0.09836973994970322,-0.0039222706109285355,-1.3760398626327515,-1.6782865524291992,-0.007874753326177597,-0.005508837755769491,-0.2517120838165283,-1.033217191696167,-1.8158061504364014,-0.000021457441107486375,-2.337657928466797,-0.4032031297683716,-2.960468292236328,-1.005089282989502,-0.1863245666027069,-0.006587219424545765,-4.298165321350098,-0.7569675445556641,-2.2668731212615967,-0.00613105483353138,-0.007397994864732027,-6.318072337307967e-6,-2.046851634979248,-0.8079216480255127,-0.14563843607902527,-0.06965262442827225,-1.3432220220565796,-0.00002002696055569686,-0.655619204044342,-0.2725275456905365,-0.000012993727978027891,-0.3141337037086487,-3.3378546504536644e-6,-0.0002944036095868796,-0.006515687331557274,-0.012326370924711227,-0.0002734287118073553,-3.576272320060525e-6,0.0,-9.65590606938349e-6,-0.01139525044709444,-0.0002857038634829223,-0.9452629685401917,-0.003506703767925501,-0.09070028364658356,-9.536697689327411e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-0.009588142856955528,-0.0011270844843238592,-1.7881377516459906e-6,0.0,-0.000028490614567999728,-1.2624571323394775,-0.02998586930334568,-0.012474958784878254,-0.0014028241857886314,-0.2540975511074066,-0.13410475850105286,-0.6323325634002686,-7.510157047363464e-6,-0.03230457007884979,-0.11868586391210556,-0.7130553126335144,-0.013674040324985981,-3.2755305767059326,-0.025730624794960022,-0.8228148221969604,0.0,-1.3843159675598145,-0.000022172682292875834,-0.000017762025890988298,-0.002557937288656831,0.0,-0.007073360960930586,-0.0003250309091527015,-0.03926125168800354,-0.0000977468371274881,-0.29631710052490234,0.0,-0.0006033745594322681,-0.00032431588624604046,-0.006333043798804283,-0.01635749265551567,-0.000045060096454108134,-0.0005951540661044419,-0.0006833125371485949,-0.00023815179883968085,-0.0023279490415006876,-0.0003219324571546167,-1.5497195136049413e-6,-0.3475494682788849,-0.355396568775177,-0.5431571006774902,-0.01269544567912817,-3.933898824470816e-6,-1.311301275563892e-6,-0.00013302871957421303,-0.00014304091746453196,-0.009059750474989414,-0.00454381387680769,-0.03110232576727867,-0.000022172682292875834,-0.00016699827392585576,-0.11941566318273544,-7.510157047363464e-6,-0.00005590759246842936,-0.009966609068214893,-0.0001389883691444993,-0.11107032001018524,-1.2295353412628174,-0.48651254177093506,-0.2677401304244995,-3.542398452758789,-0.3565519452095032,-0.30000951886177063,-0.05780236795544624,-2.5906460285186768,-0.000028490614567999728,-0.35833901166915894,-0.051513008773326874,-2.0265558760002023e-6,-0.08813172578811646,-0.00468039233237505,-0.02953273244202137,-0.0003494605771265924,-0.006835884414613247,-0.00005972207145532593,-0.25368252396583557,-0.008058298379182816,-0.0023313979618251324,-9.536738616588991e-7,-4.768370445162873e-7,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.2542930841445923,-0.012927415780723095,-3.3378546504536644e-6,-0.0008055302896536887,-0.00015948931104503572,-0.00022599527437705547,-0.004138715099543333,-0.0002848696312867105,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.30950483679771423,-2.3841855067985307e-7,-0.00004732496745418757,-0.000068662193370983,-0.0014172281371429563,-0.000012874520507466514,-3.576278118089249e-7,0.0,-4.768370445162873e-7,-0.0009386900928802788,-5.8412379075889476e-6,-0.23311828076839447,-0.0016794399125501513,-8.583032467868179e-6,-0.0008177988929674029,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.0001479277852922678,-2.145764938177308e-6,-1.1920928244535389e-7,0.0,-1.5497195136049413e-6,-0.011482697911560535,-0.0000128745205074

{"text":"<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nFind the product of $218_9 \\cdot 5_9$.  Express your answer in base 9.\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo find the product of $218_9 \\cdot 5_9$, we'll perform multiplication step by step.\n\nFirst, let's understand the multiplication process in base 9.\n\nThe multiplication process in base 9 is similar to base 10, except that the digits range from 0 to 8. \n\nWe'll multiply $218_9$ by $5_9$, which is equivalent to multiplying $218$ by $5$ in base 10.\n\n1. Multiply $218_9$ by the ones digit of $5_9$ (which is $5$).\n \n   $218_9 \\cdot 5_9$ \n   $= 218_9 \\cdot 5_9$ (ones digit of $218_9$ is $8$)\n   $= 1088_9$\n\n2. However, we need to place the result of step 1 in the ones place, and then consider the tens and higher place values of $218_9$.\n\n   To do this, we'll multiply the tens digit of $218_9$ (which is $1$) by $5$, and add the product of the hundreds digit of $218_9$ (which is $2$) by $5$.\n\n   Then, we'll consider the result of step 1, and add it to the product of the multiplication in this step. \n\n   So, we'll first find the product of $1 \\cdot 5$ and $2 \\cdot 5$.\n\n   $1 \\cdot 5 + 2 \\cdot 5 = 5 + 10 = 15$\n\n   Now, we'll convert the result to base 9.\n\n   $15 = 1 \\cdot 9 + 6$\n   $= 16_9$\n\n   In the next step, we need to align the carry from $15$ ($6$ in base 9) with the result of step 1 ($1088_9$).\n\n   So, the result of multiplying $1 \\cdot 5$ and $2 \\cdot 5$ is $166_9$.\n\n   Now, let's add the result of step 1 ($1088_9$) and the result of this step ($166_9$).\n\n   $166_9 + 1088_9$\n   $= 1254_9$\n\n   Therefore, the product of $218_9 \\cdot 5_9$ is
