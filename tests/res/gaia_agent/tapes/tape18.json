Likewise, if [George Frederic Watts](/wiki/George_Frederic_Watts \"George Frederic Watts\") is remembered at all nowadays it's as the painter of formal portraits of dignitaries and of earnestly portentious paintings with titles like *Love and Death* and *The Slumber of the Ages*, not as the painter of dramatic landscapes. *[After the Deluge](/wiki/After_the_Deluge_(painting) \"After the Deluge (painting)\")* is an explicitly religious painting, yet contains no religious imagery of any kind, and is an interesting snapshot of the transition between 19th-century symbolism and 20th-century abstraction. Because this has spent the last century in the backwater of [Compton](/wiki/Compton,_Guildford \"Compton, Guildford\") rather than in a high-profile institution like the Tate Gallery or the Yale Center for British Art, there hasn't been all that much written about this particular piece so the article is shorter than usual, but I believe this collates together everything significant that there is to say about it. And yes, I know it looks like I've accidentally cut-and-pasted a chunk of body text into the wikilink but [Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory)—The Morning after the Deluge—Moses Writing the Book of Genesis](/wiki/Light_and_Colour_(Goethe%27s_Theory)_%E2%80%93_The_Morning_after_the_Deluge_%E2%80%93_Moses_Writing_the_Book_of_Genesis \"Light and Colour (Goethe's Theory) – The Morning after the Deluge – Moses Writing the Book of Genesis\") genuinely is the name of Turner's painting of the same subject. ‑ [Iridescent](/wiki/User:Iridescent \"User:Iridescent\") [10:42, 13 November 2016 (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Featured_log/November_2016#c-Iridescent-2016-11-13T10:42:00.000Z-After_the_Deluge_(painting)-1)[reply]\n\n#### Comments by Lingzhi\n\n[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/After_the_Deluge_(painting)/archive1&action=edit&section=T-2 \"Edit section: Comments by Lingzhi\")]\n* I'm wondering whether the \"A transcendent power of light...\" quote would be more appropriate for the \"Subject\" section...  [Lingzhi](/wiki/User:Lingzhi \"User:Lingzhi\") ♦ [(talk)](/wiki/User_talk:Lingzhi \"User talk:Lingzhi\") [11:31, 13 November 2016 (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Featured_log/November_2016#c-Lingzhi-2016-11-13T11:31:00.000Z-Comments_by_Lingzhi)[reply]\n\n* I put it in its current location (about its 1891 exhibition) because Watts didn't include it with either the 1886 exhibition or with its later permanent exhibition in Compton; plus, the \"Subject\" and \"Composition\" sections each already include a quotation and I was trying to avoid the appearance of a quotefarm as much as possible.

Basically, Watts (along with virtually everyone else at this time) was part of the fad for painting classical subjects and often dabbled with Greek and Roman gods (and with more abstract Christian concepts like the personifications of Faith, Hope and Charity), but with this particular painting he wanted viewers to get the impression of a single all-powerful God showing off what he could do, even though a viewer could equally reasonably interpret it as a trial of strength between a sun-god and a water-god. ‑ [Iridescent](/wiki/User:Iridescent \"User:Iridescent\") [17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Featured_log/November_2016#c-Iridescent-2016-11-13T17:15:00.000Z-Iridescent-2016-11-13T17:15:00.000Z)[reply]\n\n* \"Watts worked on the painting for a further five years, and the completed version was eventually exhibited at the New Gallery in 1891.\" \"eventually\" seems surplasage.\n\n* I've reworded it to \"the completed version was exhibited for the first time [in 1891]\"; I agree that \"eventually\" isn't appropriate, but I want to communicate that after its first exhibition he withdrew it and didn't show it again until it had reached its final state. (I'm assuming a lot of the traffic to this will be coming from the much better known *[Hope](/wiki/Hope_(painting) \"Hope (painting)\")*, where Watts painted multiple versions and sold off or gave away the preliminary versions, so some readers will reasonably assume that was his usual way of working.) ‑ [Iridescent](/wiki/User:Iridescent \"User:Iridescent\") [17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Featured_log/November_2016#c-Iridescent-2016-11-13T17:15:00.000Z-Iridescent-2016-11-13T17:15:00.000Z-1)[reply]\n\n* \"around the country\" I'd let this pass if there had been any geographical hint in text beyond that of Whitechapel, so I'd be more specific.\n\n* Amended to \"around the United Kingdom\" in the lead—in the body text \"Cork, Edinburgh, Manchester, Dublin and London\" is spelled out so I think the \"around the country\" can stay. ‑ [Iridescent](/wiki/User:Iridescent \"User:Iridescent\") [17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Featured_log/November_2016#c-Iridescent-2016-11-13T17:15:00.000Z-Iridescent-2016-11-13T17:15:00.000Z-2)[reply]\n\n* \"fellow artists, and has been cited as an influence on numerous other artists\" artists/artists\n\n* Changed one of the instances to \"painters\". ‑ [Iridescent](/wiki/User:Iridescent \"User:Iridescent\") [17:15, 13 November 2016 (UTC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Featured_log/November_2016#c-Iridescent-2016-11-13T17:15:00.000Z-Iridescent-2016-11-13T17:15:00.000Z-3)[reply]\n\n* \"His portraits were extremely highly regarded,[8] and in 1867 he was elected a Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist,[6][A] although he rapidly became disillusioned with the culture of the Royal Academy.\" This seems needlessly complex.

The article is about Mr Cooper, who is the recipient of *People*'s \"Sexiest Man Alive\" in 2011, though it's more of \"Sexiest White Man Alive\". Aside from the so-called accolade, he is a talented actor, having found his breakthrough in his mid 30s in late 2000s. The article was promoted on 1st of September by [Jaguar](/wiki/User:Jaguar \"User:Jaguar\") who passed it straight away and found it to be FAC material.

Also, please not that i am not completely aware of the subject.  I myself have a terrible cold right now. Lead* \"He aspired to an acting career from a young age, and moved to New York City to enroll in the MFA program at the Actors Studio in 2000.\" — A rather fine sentence, but it would be better to rewrite it as \"..., and enrolled in the MFA program at the Actors Studio, New York City in 2000.\" * film debut came? happened is a better word i guess. * The Academy awards nominations were said to be four. But, the best actor mentioned are two and supporting actor is one. What has gone wrong? * It is better to mention Oscar as Academy only. * Hey, if the Tony award he was nominated for is only for that play, i suggest you remove its mention in the third paragraph. * In the last line, are both the honours related to 2011?  Early life* We have introduced him in the beginning itself as Bradley Charles Cooper: once in the lead and once in the infobox. Is it really necessary to start the first paragraph with full name? * He was raised Roman Catholic. I believe that \"as a\" is missing here. * \"His parents were initially unsure about his career choice. \"[They] ideally, would have wanted me to do something in finance\", he says. They eventually changed their perceptions when they saw Cooper play the part of John Merrick in an excerpt from the play The Elephant Man (1977).\" — This whole line can be rephrased to \"Initially apprehensive, Cooper's parents changed their perceptions after watching him play the part of John Merrick in an excerpt from the play *The Elephant Man* (1977).\" I am not against using quotes, but i felt that keeping it simple here would be a better option. * Just say the academy in the second line of the next paragraph. We have already mentioned its name earlier.  Career* In the first sub section, there are some long sentences which can be split into two at least for better reading. For example, \"Cooper's cinematic debut came in the ensemble comedy Wet Hot American Summer (2001), a film that takes place at a fictional summer camp in 1981, and features him as Ben, the love interest of Michael Ian Black's character.\" Surely can be split into two. * Is *My Little Eye* so important, considering that he played only a minor role in it? * *The Hangover* part is well written. :) * In *Limitless* portions, what was the critic talking about? the actor's performance or the film's success? Please mention it. * \"in a remake of *A Star is Born*.\" Please mention the original clearly.  I found the remaining sections well written, to the behest of my knowledge. I have nothing to say about the sources, citing, images etc. as they shall be handled properly by source and image reviewers. I find this article worthy enough.
