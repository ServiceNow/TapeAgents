Place the first tower 4 miles in to cover the first house.\n5. Move forward 4 miles from the first tower. The first tower also covers the house above mile marker 8. \n6. Find the next uncovered house below mile marker 12.\n7. Move 4 miles in from the uncovered house and place a second tower. The house is now covered. \n8. Move forward 4 miles from the second tower. The second tower also covers the house above mile marker 16.\n9. Find the next uncovered house below mile marker 25.\n10. Move 4 miles in from the uncovered house and place a third tower.
