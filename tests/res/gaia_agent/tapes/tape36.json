The final round offered Bob the chance to win a large sum by playing a game against the host. The host has 30 shiny prop coins, each of which is worth $1,000 if Bob manages to win them by playing the game. The host hides the coins in three different prize boxes and then shuffles their order. The only rule restricting the host's coin placement is that one box must contain at least 2 coins, and one box must contain 6 more coins than another box. In order to play, Bob must submit three guesses, one guess for the number of coins in each box. The box is then opened and the number of coins is revealed. If Bob's guess is a number greater than the number of coins in the box, Bob earns no coins. If Bob guesses a number equal to or less than the number of coins in the box, Bob wins a number of coins equal to his guess.\n\nIf Bob plays uses the optimal strategy, what's the minimum amount of money he can win from the game?",

If you name (12, 12, 12), you will win at least 12 coins.\n\nIf you name some triple where one of the numbers is more than 12, then it's possible that box only has 12, and you win nothing from it. If you are to win from *both* the other boxes, your other two named numbers must be at most 2, since the other boxes could have 2 and 16. So then you'd win at most 4 total. If you are to win from exactly *one* of the other two boxes, they might have 8 and 10 and you'd win at most 10 total.\n\nIf you name some triple where your *lowest* number is less than 12 but more than 4, then it's possible that box has 26, and you win nothing from the other two boxes which have 0 and 4 coins. And you only win your lowest named number which we assumed is less than 12.\n\nIf your lowest called number is 4 or lower, that box may again have 26, and you can't do better than winning that number plus the 4 from the box with 4. So no better than 8 total.\n\nSo your lowest named number is at least 12, and none of your named numbers are more than 12. So the best you can do is guarantee 12 coins with (12,12,12). Note we've shown this is the *only* triple to guarantee 12 won coins.\n\n[Share](/a/2603301 \"Short permalink to this answer\")\n\nCite\n\n Follow\n\n[edited Jan 13, 2018 at 9:33](/posts/2603301/revisions \"show all edits to this post\")\n\n answered Jan 13, 2018 at 7:57\n\n[![2'5 9'2's user avatar](https://i.sstatic.net/J1i6U.png?s=64)](/users/11123/25-92)\n\n[2'5 9'2](/users/11123/25-92)2'5 9'2\n\n55.8k88 gold badges8484 silver badges159159 bronze badges\n\n$\\endgroup$\n\n[Add a comment](# \"Use comments to ask for more information or suggest improvements.

Firstly, we have (10, 10, 10) to ensure we get the most coins in a situation with no constraints. However, here, we have to take note of the 4 coins, so I would say (10, 8, 12).\n\nHowever, should the boxes with more coins be unknown to us, then alex's answer of (12, 12, 12) would be more suitable.\n\n[Share](/a/2603298 \"Short permalink to this answer\")\n\nCite\n\n Follow\n\n[edited Jan 13, 2018 at 8:01](/posts/2603298/revisions \"show all edits to this post\")\n\n answered Jan 13, 2018 at 7:48\n\n[![QuIcKmAtHs's user avatar](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/074040db5e59bc608cfcebf9b259ebc7?s=64&d=identicon&r=PG)](/users/515633/quickmaths)\n\n[QuIcKmAtHs](/users/515633/quickmaths)QuIcKmAtHs\n\n1,4651313 silver badges2727 bronze badges\n\n$\\endgroup$\n\n4\n\n* $\\begingroup$\nIf the box you apply 8 to has 26, 24, 22, 20, or 18 coins, then this strategy only gives you 8 coins.
