The left side features a slice of cake illustrating the concept of fractions, where the numerator (3 in 3/4) indicates the portion of the cake that remains, while the denominator (4) represents the total parts the cake is divided into. The text explains the importance of simplifying fractions, highlighting that a fraction is in its simplest form when it cannot be reduced further. It also emphasizes the equivalence of simplified and non-simplified fractions, using examples like 2/4 and 1/2 to illustrate this point.\n\nBelow the explanation, there are sample problems for practicing fraction simplification, inviting users to fill in the answers for various fractions. The right side of the image features colorful illustrations of bags, reinforcing the concept of multiplication with the equation 4 x 3 = 12. Overall, this image serves as a comprehensive introduction to understanding and simplifying fractions, essential for mastering basic arithmetic skills.\n\n# Text detected by OCR:\nArithmetic edit edit source Arithmetic has to deal with elementaryibasic levels of math, such as division, multiplication, subtraction and addition.
