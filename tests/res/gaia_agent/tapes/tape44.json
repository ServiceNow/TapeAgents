My friend from class sent me an audio recording of Professor Willowbrook giving out the recommended reading for the test, but my headphones are broken :(\n\nCould you please listen to the recording for me and tell me the page numbers I'm supposed to go over? I've attached a file called Homework.mp3 that has the recording. Please provide just the page numbers as a comma-delimited list. And please provide the list in ascending order.\nMP3 document content:\n### Audio Transcript:\nBefore you all go, I want to remind you that the midterm is next week. Here's a little hint. You should be familiar with the differential equations on page 245. Problems that are very similar to problems 32, 33 and 44 from that page might be on the test. And also some of you might want to brush up on the last page in the integration section, page 197. I know some of you struggled on last week's quiz. I foresee problem 22 from page 197 being on your midterm. Oh and don't forget to brush up on the section on related rates on pages 132, 133 and 134.",
