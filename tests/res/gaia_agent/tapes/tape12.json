This   disconnect   with   traditional\ndragons   has   been   bemoaned   as   ruining   the   mythic   and   archetypal   power   of\ndragons. Yet there may be more potent dragons lurking in children’s literature than\nreadily apparent, due to one significant aspect of traditional Western dragon-lore:\nthe eerie feeling or mood cast by a dragon. The original dragons of Germanic lore,\nfrom which many children’s literature dragons descended, were not just large scary\nbeasts,   but   they   also   created   a   distinctly   unsettling   atmosphere   in   their   stories.\nModern   tamed   and   human-like   children’s   literature   dragons   borrow   certain\nuncanny qualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not\nalways   life-threatening   characters.   In   specific,   two   traits   borrowed   from   the\noriginal lore inspire uncanny doubling with their human counterparts: the dragons’\nintensely   possessive   gaze   and   their   clever,   manipulative   speech.   This   article\nanalyzes   these  Freudian   inheritances   to   argue   that   children’s   literature   dragons\nhave   not   been   entirely   softened   and   satirized;   the   potential   for   uncanny   fear\nembodied by  the human-like  behaviors  of legendary Western dragons  lingers  in\nmany modern children’s literature dragons. This potential reveals that dragons are\nstill   strong   characters   and   can   and   should   be   analyzed   productively   through   a\nFreudian uncanny lens.\n\nKeywords: Dragon, uncanny, Freud, children’s literature\n\nBiography and contact info: Emily Midkiff (MA, English and Children's Literature) is teaching and\nworking on her PhD at the University of Minnesota.\n\nJ.R.R. Tolkien once declared that “the dragon in legend is a potent creation of men’s imagination,\nricher in significance than his barrow is in gold” (“The Monsters” 16). Dragons in mythology have\ncome   to   be   recognized   for   their   value   as   representations   of   ancient   cultures   or   as   worldwide\narchetypes. Anthropologists have found and studied dragons in nearly all surviving mythologies;\nmedievalists have examined them in manuscripts and bestiaries. In modern literature, dragons have\nflourished in their newer realm of fantasy and children’s literature as one of its most pervasive\nmythic animals.\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n41\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nThe Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature\n\nYet   within   children’s   literature,   scholars   have   noted   a   trend   beginning   even   before   the\ndragon’s mass popularity in fantasy to soften and satirize the dragon for children. While this type of\nfriendly dragon has become a well known resident of children’s  books, this  article argues that\nchildren’s literature dragons have been not been entirely softened and satirized; the potential for\nuncanny fear embodied by the human-like behaviors of legendary Western dragons lingers in many\nmodern children’s literature dragons.\n\nFluffy Dragons\n\nIn comparison to ancient dragon lore, modern dragons for children inspire less terror and more\nlaughter, beginning most noticeably with Kenneth Grahame’s “The Reluctant Dragon” in 1898.\nRuth Stein in 1968 and Margaret Blount in 1974 both comment with distaste on the increasingly\ncuddly,   “fluffy”   nature   of   dragons   in   children’s   literature.   In   a   short   article   for  Elementary\nEducation,   Stein   expresses   hope   that   Tolkien’s   Smaug   would   improve   the   literary   dragon’s\nevolution   and  encourage   properly   scary   dragons.  While   this   has   since   proved  true   in  part,   the\nbemoaned   fluffy   dragons   remain   prevalent   alongside   Tolkien’s   menacing   breed.   Nonetheless\nBlount, in a later book, stipulates that as long as dragons retain their capability to inspire awe they\ncould be less than terrifying and still remain “real dragons” (129). She points out several stories that\nfail to keep the awe of dragons alive, and most of the failures revolve around dragons that generally\nbehave like humans and sometimes retain only one dragon characteristic, usually fire-breathing, in\norder to inspire conflict. Jon Stott, in 1990, shows less concern over what a “real” dragon is and\neven praises the proliferation of fluffy dragons, including Grahame’s dragon, as parodies of the\noutdated cultural codes represented by traditional dragon lore (222-223).\n\nHope Shastri’s 1992 dissertation on the picture book dragon gives concrete results to support\nthe observations of scholars like Stein, Blount, and Stott. Shastri performed a content analysis of\n151 picture books produced between 1950 and 1992 in order to ascertain whether or not dragons\nhave preserved their range of mythic capabilities in that form of children’s literature. She divides\npicture book dragons into three categories: Household (the type that Blount accused of failure),\nWildwood (untamed, living in the wild and closer to Tolkien’s sort), and Imaginary (clearly pretend\nor a dream on the part of a child) and identifies thirty traditional dragon traits such as breathing fire,\nconsuming humans, guarding treasure, talking, flying, and being vanquished. After applying these\ncategories and traits to all 151 books, Shastri concludes that picture book dragons have effectively\nlost the majority of their original mythic qualities, save fire-breathing, and have largely become\ntame and meek—especially the Household dragons, out of which she finds 86% to be denatured as\nopposed to 34% of Wildwood and 42% of Imaginary dragons (77). Tina L. Hanlon generally agrees\nwith Shastri’s findings in her own examination of 100 picture books in 2003, but she also notes with\nsome hope the resurgence of strong dragons in retold fairy tales. In total, the work of these scholars\nover the past two decades indicates that dragons in children’s books are increasingly humorous and\nless and less fearsome, just as Stein feared when she wrote over forty years ago.\n\nDragons and the Uncanny\n\nThere  may  be  more  potent  dragons   lurking  in  children’s   literature  than  these  observations  and\nstudies indicate, due to one significant aspect of Western dragon-lore: the eerie feeling or mood cast\nby a dragon. The traits listed by Shastri focus on characteristics of the dragons themselves but do\nnot   include   the   emotional   environment   created   by   the   dragon   within   the   literature   or   with   the\naudience. Stott acknowledges the fear inspired by traditional dragons due to their size and fierce\n\n42\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 41–54\n\ntemper, but his analysis addresses only the physical threat of the dragons and implies that this fear is\nentirely lost when parodied (224). Blount comes close to recognizing this deeper psychological\neffect of dragons when she writes that a quality children’s literature dragon should still inspire awe.\nAwe   and   fear,   yes,  but   the   original   dragons   of   Germanic   lore   from   which   children’s   literature\ndragons descended were not just large scary beasts, but they also created a distinctly unsettling\natmosphere in their stories.\n\nThis uncanny quality of these ancestral dragons derives from their unnatural similarity to the\nheroes who defeat them; the dragons are doubles for humanity. Joyce Tally Lionarons and Jonathan\nEvans,   scholars   of   medieval   dragon-lore,   assert   that   dragons   such   as   the   famous   Fáfnir   were\nterrifying   and   effective   characters   in   epics   because   they   vied   with   people   for   the   right   to   be\n“human.”  According   to  the   classic  definition  by  Freud,  the   uncanny  double   occurs   when  “one\n[person] possesses   knowledge,  feelings   and  experience  in  common  with  the  other”  and  is  also\nsometimes “marked by the fact that the subject identifies himself with someone else, so that he is in\ndoubt   as   to   which   his   self   is,   or   substitutes   the   extraneous   self   for   his   own”   (234). 1  Freudian\npsychoanalysis has been applied to dragons in fairy tales by such scholars as Bruno Bettelheim, but\nhe posits dragons as the dangerous, untamed id or the projection of oedipal issues by the child hero\n(76). Bettelheim’s analysis also locates dragons as an internal hero conflict, which in many ways\ncomplements to my argument here, but I focus on Freud’s concept of the uncanny rather than his\nsuperego-ego-id construct to explain the way that modern dragons can still unsettle readers even\nwhen the plot does not follow the traditional human hero questing to slay a physically fearsome\ndragon.   Modern   tamed   and   human-like   children’s   literature   dragons   borrow   certain   uncanny\nqualities from the older generations of dragon-lore to become potent, if not life or ego-threatening\ncharacters. In specific, two traits borrowed from the original lore inspire the uncanny doubling with\nhumans: the dragons’ intensely possessive gaze and their clever, manipulative speech.\n\nThe remainder of this article will further explain how the dragon’s potent powers of vision\nand language operate as uncanny traits, how vision and language are recognized by scholars of\nGermanic dragon-lore, and how these traits were translated into children’s literature through such\nlandmark texts as Grahame’s  The Reluctant Dragon  and J.R.R. Tolkien’s Smaug in  The Hobbit\n(1937). Finally, I will examine some examples of the uncanny vision and language of the dragons of\nmodern children’s literature through the middle-grade reader How to Train Your Dragon Vol. 1 and\nthe picture book  Hush, Little Dragon. These books serve as purposeful case studies intended to\nrepresent recent English-language literature for the youngest to middle-grade readers. Each book\nwas selected out of a pool of potential recent dragon books because they represent clear, but not\nextraordinary   or   unusual,   examples   of   tamed   and   human-like   dragons,   respectively.   I   mean   to\nultimately  use  these   texts  to   demonstrate  that   while   many  commonplace  modern   dragons   have\nevolved away from their ancestors to good or bad effect, the visual potency and intimacy with\nlanguage   inherited   from   older   dragons   remain   a   potent,   if   largely   invisible,   means   of   creating\nuncanny dragons in children’s literature. Stein and Blount protest the appearance of increasingly\nhuman dragons, but this very doubling has the potential to rescue the awe of dragons as long as they\nare just different and frightening enough to achieve the uncanny.\n\n1     Admittedly, Freud dismisses fantastic tales as potential hosts for the uncanny, saying “I cannot think of any genuine fairy story\nwhich has anything uncanny about it” (246). However, many scholars before me have disregarded this qualification of the uncanny\nand applied it to fantasy and fairy tales alike. See Peter Straub’s “American Fantastic Tales: Terror and the Uncanny from Poe to the\nPulps” for an overview of the uncanny in fantastic American stories or David Rudd’s “An Eye for an I: Neil Gaiman's Coraline and\nQuestions of Identity” for a more specific application of Freud’s uncanny to a fantasy text.\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n43\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nThe Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature\n\nThe Uncanny Dragon, Then and Now\n\nThe dragon’s eyes hold much of its power, as well as its ability to inspire uncanny fear. In Freud’s\nconcept of the uncanny, the eyes are a frequent site of fear in two ways: as a displaced castration\ncomplex if the eyes are threatened, and as the evil-eye threatening oneself (231, 240). Colloquially\nconsidered windows to the soul, the eyes are also a significant cultural location for human identity.\nLikewise, the dragon’s powerful eyes are one of its identifying features and greatest assets in its\nefforts to seize human identity. When discussing the Indo-European name for the dragon, Jonathan\nEvans says that the Greek root “*drk-” originally means “to see, to watch” and “*drk-on” would\nmean   something   like   “seeing   one”   (“As   Rare”   23).   Evans   asserts   that   accordingly   many\nIndo-European dragons are watchers and guarders responsible for keeping an eye on a treasure of\nsome sort, and many have piercing or unnatural stares to discomfit potential attackers (23). The\nGreek dragon’s name and identity is based on its power of sight. The “unnatural” stare that Evans\nmentions also creates an eerie sense of the intelligence behind the dragon’s guardianship, a power\nand vision comparable if not superior to humanity’s. The human hero is responsible for guarding the\npeople, the dragon for guarding the treasure. Until one defeats the other, they are equally identified\nas powerful over-seers threatening one another’s guardianship. Traditionally, when a hero faces and\ndefeats   a   dragon,   the   slaying   extinguishes   the   dragon’s   superior   vision.   In   doing   so,   the   hero\nestablishes himself as the greater power and superior identity as watcher-guardian. This challenge\nover the hero’s watcher-identity invokes the Freudian evil-eye or blindness as castration, making the\ndragon’s threat to one’s identity as watcher-guardian uncanny.\n\nAlongside the eyes, the dragon’s uncanny powers manifest in its associations with speech.\nAs far as we know, dragons are primarily imaginary creatures that emerged from within the oral and\nwritten   realms   of   storytelling.2  In   Western   literature,   they   leapt   into   being   as   an   invention   of\nlanguage and shortly after acquired, within stories, the ability to out-speak humans. 3  In creating\nlanguage-capable monsters proficient with the tools of linguistic creation, poets and bards fashioned\nin dragons a double for themselves: the dragon as wielder of language and the raw potential for\nlanguage—including the risk that language could escape human control and become dangerous. In\nthis way dragons stole the human invention that created them and ventured uncomfortably close to\nhumanity through the ability to speak with equal or superior eloquence. While other animals speak\nin legend and fairy tale, most of these creatures existed before language named them, and their\nwords are simple and communicative.  Dragons in contrast could not exist without language, and\nhave a high language skill demonstrated through fondness for riddling talk and a tendency to use it\naggressively.4 Furthermore, traditional dragons are notoriously evil where regular animals are not.\nDeirdre Dwen Pitts writes that folklore animals  “date from the time when the world was not yet\nman-oriented and man and animal struggled together against uncontrollable natural forces” (169).\nThese animals are on the humans’ side: “Animals are rarely the antagonists in these tales; enemies\nare usually undefined monsters, ogres, witches, giants, devils, demons, with only an occasional\nwolf” (169). Oddly missing from this list are dragons, which are also frequent enemies and shadows\nof humanity. The dragon is, like the uncanny, that which “ought to have remained secret and hidden\nbut has come to light” (Freud 225). Many of the most terrifying and memorable dragons rely on\n\n2     See Grafton Elliot Smith’s The Evolution of the Dragon, Charles Gould’s Dragons, Unicorns, and Sea Serpents: A Classic\nStudy of the Evidence for their Existence, Ernest Ingersoll’s Dragons and Dragon Lore, and David E. Jones’s An Instinct for\nDragons for an overview of the classic and updated debates on where the dragon in myth came from, whether or not it ever\nexisted, and how it spread across the world.\n3         The oldest proto-dragons were mythic characters like the Babylonian Tiamat, a goddess who could of course speak.\nHowever, this paper largely concerns Western dragons from the point when we can culturally recognize them as dragons. It is\nat this point that the dragon’s relationship with language becomes noticeable and also problematic.\n4     The sphinx and trolls, other frequently riddling creatures, are recognized as proto-dragons. See the work of Charles Gould\nand Ernest Ingersoll in works cited.\n\n44\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 41–54\n\ntheir   use   of   language   to   inspire   fear   and   awe   due   to   being   distinctly   unwelcome   doubles   for\nhumanity.\n\nAlthough the dragon may imitate humanity through its roles as watcher and speaker, its\nphysical properties keep it unfamiliar enough to be uncanny. The dragon’s appearance comes down\nas   inconsistent   through   European   lore,   but   the   medieval   dragon   is   never   nice-looking   or\naesthetically   pleasing.   This   traditional   dragon   combines   frightening   and   uncomfortable   aspects\ntaken from beasts who threaten humanity: snakes, big cats, and birds of prey. 5 Therefore when this\nundesirable   anti-human   claims   human   identity,   the   thought   becomes   inherently   unsettling   to\nhumans. Having this conglomeration of everything that one finds frightening and uncomfortable\nnearly   become   the   same   as   oneself   produces   the   uncanny   doubling   effect.   Furthermore,   Freud\nsuggests that the familiar unfamiliar of the uncanny is the result of repressed experiences (241);\naccordingly many of these old stories imply that the dragon embodies the repressed dark side of the\nhero.\n\nIn the medieval Germanic dragon myths, the dragon watching over a hoard becomes an\nuncanny double for the hero watching over the people. In Beowulf, the poet uses identical words to\ndescribe   the   roles   of  Beowulf   and   the   dragon.  At   different   times   he  calls   them   both  aglæcan,\nmeaning “warrior,” and only context distinguishes the hero from the dragon (Lionarons 30). The\nsame phrase hordweard or “hoard-guardian” refers to both. The dragon’s lair is called a dryhtsele,\nthe term used for a human king’s hall (30). These examples of parallel naming reveal the doubled\nnatures of hero and dragon as well as their conflicting positions. They perform the same job, but\nonly one can succeed. In the inevitable conflict, the two guardians are so similar they nearly cancel\none   another   out.   Both   kill   one   another;   only   narrowly   does   Beowulf   come   out   on   top   as   the\nsuccessful overseer. By killing the dragon, he proves an effective guardian of his people from the\ndragon menace, but he also performs the final viewing and therefore possession of the dragon’s\ntreasure. The two concepts are connected, as the poet shows through Beowulf’s insistence upon\nseeing the treasure before dying. When Wiglaf brings it to him, Beowulf gazes on it and says, “I\ngive thanks / that I behold this treasure here in front of me, / that I have been allowed to leave my\npeople / so well endowed on the day I die” (ln 2795-2798). He believes the treasure he has won\ncould support his people, and therefore what the dragon has been watching over has been converted\nto a part of Beowulf’s ward. His ability to look on the treasure assures him that he has won the\nbattle of eyes.\n\nThe language of the Germanic dragons also doubled them with humans, and in two ways:\nthe way that the dragons were spoken about and the way that they spoke. Aside from how similar\nwords are used in Beowulf to align the hero and the dragon, the Indo-European dragon-slaying myth\nhas its own special verb formula reserved for the epic killing of dragons. In her book on medieval\ndragons, Lionarons points out that instead of an active verb such as “to slay,” the dragon-slaying\nverb is self-reflexive and roughly translates “to become slayer to” (6). The action of slaying defines\nthe hero/slayer against the dragon/slain. The way this particular verb functions, Lionarons notes,\n“suggests   a   covert   similarity   between   subject   and   object,   hero   and   dragon”   (6).   The   cosmic\ndragon-slaying myth and later the legendary hero tale, she explains, worked through one voice\nsilencing the other—the battle is over language since the winner gets to declare himself to be the\ngod/hero and the loser to be the dragon (8). The need for such a battle reveals the uncomfortable\nsimilarity   between   heroes   and   dragons   in   the   tales   of   dragon-slayers   such   as   Sigurd,  Þiđrek,\nBeowulf, and  Thor. Each hero ultimately defines himself as the hero; it is the narrow margin of\nsuccess and uncertain hero status that creates the uncanniness.\n\n5         Smith   uses   this   combination   of   predator   traits   as   the   foundation   for   his   theory   that   dragons   result   from   residual\npredator-prey instincts left over from the evolution of humanity. In his book, he details how these attributes are present in\nevery mythological dragon in every culture across the world.\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n45\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nThe Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature\n\nThe dragons also use language to fight for the speaking, dominant role, as can be seen in the\nverbal battle that occurs at the death of the dragon Fáfnir. In the Volsunga Saga version, the hero\nSigurd kills Fáfnir through a trick; the actual violence is brief. As the dragon slowly dies, it speaks\n(Volsunga 78). Lionarons claims that the conversation is riskier than the attack, for despite Fáfnir’s\nmortal wounds, he threatens to take the winner’s right as silencer through engaging the Germanic\ngenres of the senna, death song, and wisdom poetry (69). The senna is a stylized battle of words\naccomplished through ritual insults and challenges meant to establish one’s social place. When\nFáfnir engages Sigurd in this battle, as Armann Jakobsson puts it, “readers will be prone to an eerie\nfeeling   that   the  dragon   is   somehow   outwitting   Sigurđr”  (31).  This   eerie   feeling   results  from  a\ndistinctly   non-human   entity   fighting   for   the   human   social   rank   of   hero,   and   doing   well.   The\ndragon’s skill at word-play indicates that the non-human may actually be better at the human’s\ngame of language. Fáfnir nearly wins through wisdom poetry that touches on the cosmological and\nsilences the hero. Sigurd, in his efforts to outsmart Fáfnir and find an unanswerable question, asks\nabout the end of the world: “How namest thou the holm whereon Surt and the Æsir mix and mingle\nin  the   water  of  the   sword?”   (Volsung  80)  Surt,  the  fire  giant,   is   fated   to  destroy  the   world  at\nRagnarok in a battle against the Æsir. The beginning and the end of the world in Norse myth\nrevolve around the conquering and resurgence of chaos, embodied in part by the Midgard Serpent,\nJormungandr, the immense dragon that was defeated at the world’s creation by Thor and will in turn\ndefeat Thor at Ragnarok. In asking about the cosmic end, Sigurd questions the farthest reaches of\nwisdom and speech, being and non-being, and the cosmic battle of dragon and hero, which he is\nre-enacting in miniature. Fáfnir replies, in many translations: “Unshapen is that holm hight,” or the\nisland   is   not   named   (80).   In   the   original   Icelandic,   he   calls   the   island   “Oskopnir”   (Hunt).\nTranslations of the “The Lay of Fafnir” from the Elder Edda often phrase the reply: “Oskopnir it is\ncalled” (174). August Hunt claims that translating the word as a mere lack of name misrepresents it.\nThe –nir is a basic Icelandic suffix, but combined with Oskop-, meaning “umade,” it could instead\nindicate the “island of unmaking” (Hunt). Therefore the island could be not yet made, not yet\nnamed, or the place of the final unmaking. Possibly all three at once, straining the human mind to\nembrace   the   dragon’s   polysemic   phrasing.   Fáfnir’s   bewildering   understanding   and   deft   verbal\nexpression of cosmic knowledge hushes Sigurd. The dragon’s next words, Lionarons claims, change\nfrom wisdom poetry to a death song—a genre reserved for dying heroes. Sigurd interrupts and\nsteers them back into the senna, narrowly getting the last word and walking away with his victory\nand identity as the hero intact. This threatening similarity between Sigurd and Fáfnir exemplifies\nthe speaking dragon’s uncanny ability to become the supreme double and threat to humanity.\n\nFrom Victorian Satire to Modern Fantasy\n\nFollowing the medieval surge of Christianity in Europe, the Germanic legends of Western dragons\nbecame   inextricably   tied   to   the   Devil-dragon   of   Revelation   and   far   too   allegorical   for   use   in\ncommon secular stories, according to Ruth Berman. Not until the late 1800’s, with the discoveries\nof dinosaur remains, were dragons tenable outside of allegory (Berman 220). At that point, Berman\nclaims, Kenneth  Grahame’s   lighthearted,  secular  story “The  Reluctant  Dragon”  in  1898  helped\nresurrect the dragon from its allegorical existence. Grahame’s was a carefree and satirical dragon—\nfar removed from the heavy religious matter of Revelation. Grahame’s version retained only subtle\ntraces of the dragon’s menacing eyes and language and made his dragon prefer poetry or being a\nspectacle over fighting. Again, a human hero of the tale, the shepherd’s boy, doubles the dragon in\nthat he also writes poetry, “heaps of it” in fact, and would very much like to watch a spectacle\n(335).  The   dragon   and   the   boy   differ   though,   when   it   comes   to   violence.  The   dragon   prefers\ngrammar and chastises the boy: “Don’t be violent, Boy, . . . Sit down and get your breath, and try to\n\n46\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 41–54\n\nremember that the noun governs the verb” (337 emphasis in  the  original). The boy wants a fight\nbetween the dragon and St. George, whereas the dragon wants to compose sonnets and be visually\nadmired. Eerily, compared to the Germanic tradition, this preference implies that the dragon has\nwon and bears the human values of peace, tolerance, and love of beauty (and good grammar) more\nthan the humans. The dragon openly resembles humans and has more desirable human traits than\nthe hero. Grahame’s dragon uses his lingering expertise with vision and words to find a place in\nsociety with just as much if not more status than the hero—only he accomplishes it nonviolently. St.\nGeorge agrees to help the dragon create the illusion of a battle, culminating with the visual trick of a\nstab “in the spare place agreed upon” in the dragon’s neck-folds  (347). This  battle upends the\ndragon/hero struggle for visual dominance as the dragon and hero use it against the common people\ninstead. The dragon then uses persuasive, eloquent language to rise in society to the point that “the\nSaint and the Boy, as they looked on, felt that they were only assisting at a feast of which the\nhonour and glory were entirely the dragon’s” (348). The dragon’s language here is a joke on the\nsenna, the ritual of insults and boasts to gain social standing. In the end, the reluctant dragon uses\neyes and language to claim humanity in a milder, subtler way than in the Germanic lore. Grahame,\nin   avoiding   the   evil   associations   of   the   Satan-dragon   of   Revelation,   suppressed   the   dragon’s\nuncanny verbal power further below the surface. His dragon is hardly scary, but it clearly wins “the\nhonour and glory” (348). However, the reluctant dragon’s uncanny victory does not mean that every\nkindly dragon carries this underlying success. Edith Nesbit’s friendly dragon in “The Last of the\nDragons” (1925), for instance, is tame and prone to crying over small kindnesses. In the end, the\ndragon submits to being transformed into the first airplane since he is desperate to serve humanity\n—a far cry from Grahame’s dragon’s subtle conquest and put-down to humanity. Not all children’s\nliterature dragons seem to take up these uncanny aspects, but Grahame’s version demonstrates that\nthe potential is there, even in satire.\n\nTolkien,   a   scholar   of   Germanic   literature   and   vocal   fan   of   its   monsters,   refreshed   the\nuncanny   and   traditional   dragon   traits   in   his   influential   fiction.  Tolkien’s   dragon   Glaurung   was\nmodeled   on   Fáfnir   and   paved   the   way   for   scary,   language-manipulating   dragons   in   children’s\nliterature. Evans has noted that the Volsunga Saga shaped Tolkien’s tale of Túrin Túrambar (“The\nDragon-Lore” 24). In this tale, Glaurung catches Túrin in his gaze and holds him, speaking horrors\ninto his mind and through his eyes. Later he holds the gaze of Túrin’s sister Nienor for days until\nshe is stripped of her memory and identity. Túrin is “bemused by the eyes of the dragon” to the\npoint that he “believed the words of Glaurung” to his demise (Silmarillion 214). The dragon’s eyes\nallow his words to penetrate. In Glaurung, Tolkien synthesizes the dragon’s power of sight and\nuncanny   lingual   skill.   Tolkien’s   later   dragon   Smaug,   who   was   intended   for   a   child   audience,\npreserves the eeriness of the dragon’s glowing gaze but focuses on the dragon’s speech. When Bilbo\napproaches   Smaug   for   the   second   time,   the   paragraph   of   description   concludes   with   the   terse,\npowerful sentence, “Then Smaug spoke” (Hobbit 241). Jakobsson explains that at “the moment it\nspeaks, it becomes a character, an intelligent person who is not merely governed by his bestial\ninstincts.” (28). Smaug’s suave power of speech makes him an eerie cross between human and\nbeast, and increases his threat to the humanoid characters (29). Thus Smaug can be held up as an\nearly model for the overtly (more so than Grahame’s, anyway) uncanny and dangerous dragon in\nchildren’s literature.\n\nTolkien is regularly recognized as a foundation of modern fantasy, and his reconstitution of\nthe ancient eeriness of dragons is likely to have influenced many other fantasy writers who took up\nthe dragon. Ursula K. Le Guin and Anne McCaffrey both used the dragon’s lingual skill to redefine\ndragons’ bond with humanity, and their versions continue to affect literary dragons. However, their\nsort of clearly powerful dragons dwell primarily in young adult and adult fantasy. Books intended\nfor the youngest readers instead temper Tolkien’s potency with Grahame’s subtlety, disguising most\npowerful   dragons.   Not   all   children’s   literature   dragons   unlock   this   potential—in   fact   it   often\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n47\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nThe Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature\n\nremains entirely untapped, as with Nesbit’s dragon—but there are still powerful dragons created by\nwriters who choose to or unintentionally employ the methods of uncanny doubling adapted from\nGermanic lore by Grahame and Tolkien.\n\nThe Dragon in the Nursery Mirror\n\nWithin   children’s   books   reside   many   overlooked   frightening   and   uncanny   dragons.

While these dragons do not guard or watch, their eyes inherit Smaug’s glowering menace.\nThe hero Hiccup recalls learning that “the gaze of a dragon is hypnotic and gives the unnerving\nfeeling that it is sucking your soul away” (71). This “unnerving feeling” parallels the uncanny.\nHypnotic or magic eyes imply that a dragon’s gaze may overpower a human’s. In this way dragons\nhave the phallic power and the concept of sucking the soul threatens identity, even if it is only\nactualized as a feeling. Even in the illustrations (ostensibly drawn by Hiccup) the dragon’s eyes are\nregularly more sharply drawn than the humans’ relatively round ones. Since the powers of dragons\nin this book are relative to their size, Hiccup finds later that the massive sea dragons have such\npowerful vision that they can see beyond the physical world. When he asks the sea dragon how it\nknows all about his family and problems, the dragon simply says, “I can see things like that” (154).\nThis vision transcends the plane of physical reality, a truly staggering power beyond humanity’s\ncapabilities even in this fantasy world. The only drawing of Hiccup’s meeting with the giant sea\ndragon mirrors the massively frightening visual capabilities of the dragon: the dragon’s eye looms\nbehind and dwarfs Hiccup, who is smaller than the reptilian slit pupil of the sea dragon’s eye. As the\nsole visual representation of their banter, this image encapsulates the entire terrifying encounter\nthrough the enormous size and power implied by the dragon’s eye.\n\nLanguage   in   Cowell’s   book   superficially   separates   the   humans   from   the   dragons   while\nshowing them to be the same. Neither side is competing for the right to speak, but rather they are\nboth speaking and ignoring one another; the humans win only due to size. The Viking humans of\nthe story train the smaller species of dragons to behave like hunting dogs through yelling at them as\nloudly as possible. While the dragons do speak their own language, Dragonese, there is a strict law\nagainst speaking to dragons in their own language. The Vikings justify their law thus: “Dragons\nmight get above themselves if we talk to them. Dragons are tricksy and must be kept in their place”\n(142). Cowell overtly makes language here the differentiating point between humans and dragons\nand a tool for the former to subjugate the latter. Despite the law, some of the Vikings want to deny\nthat dragons can speak at all. When the young hero Hiccup tries speaking to his tiny pet dragon\nToothless, his human friend shouts, “You can’t talk to it, it’s an ANIMAL, for Thor’s sake!” (71).\nAs a point of similarity between humans and dragons, language is a repressed topic for the Vikings.\nErasing this fabricated line makes dragons uncannily close to humanity and not qualified to remain\nin the category of animals. In reaction, the Vikings try to define the dragons as far from humanity.\n\n48\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 41–54\n\nThe dragons want to be distinguished from the humans just as fervently. They claim that\nthey are better, but they also deny their similarities to humans. The dragons’ language itself, which\nputs them on par with humans, is just a different dialect of the Viking’s language (which is English,\nin this universe). One silly informational page states, “dragons are the only other creatures who\nspeak   a   language   as   complicated   and   sophisticated   as   humans”   (70).  This   is   its   own   joke,   as\nDragonese is a dialect where “Doit a wummortime” printed in a jagged font or spoken out loud with\n“shrill shrieks and popping noises” is the colloquial equivalent of just what it sounds like: “Let’s try\nthat again” (70). Dragonese is only as complex as the human language because it is essentially the\nsame. The silliness of this doubling recalls the Grahame tradition, wherein the eeriness of dragons is\nretained under the guise of humor. Instead of praising either language, Cowell’s informational page\ncompares the stubbornness of both races behind the joke, which reveals that they’re speaking the\nsame one. The Vikings do not want to admit that the dragons have a language to speak; neither side\nwants to recognize that Dragonese is merely another dialect of the human language. Both sides\nrefuse to talk to one another, drawing them into further parallel.\n\nEven Hiccup—as progressive, unusual and creative as he is—is uncomfortable with talking\nto the dragons. He resists at first and later avoids proficient use of the language. He lists “jokes and\nriddling talk” as the last item on his list of possible ways to motivate his dragon and adds the note\n“only if I’m desperate” (92). Jokes and riddling talk are not just speaking Dragonese, but speaking\nspecial formulas within it that indicate fluency and clever manipulation of the words. Hiccup is\nclearly   uncomfortable,   but   only   successfully   communicates   with   Toothless   through   jokes.   His\ndiscomfort reveals that it is psychologically troubling to him to be getting so close to his dragon\nthrough its language.\n\nWhen   the   giant   sea   dragon   shows   up,   Hiccup   must   graduate   from   the   less\ncomplicated   realm   of   jokes   and   into   full-blown   riddling   talk.   He   joins   the   sea   dragon   in\nphilosophical pondering akin to Sigurd and Fáfnir’s wisdom poetry, but about the nature of death.\nThe dragon here verbally accomplishes the feat of putting humans and dragons, regardless of size\nand status, on the same level: “We are all, in a sense, supper. . . . even a murderous carnivore like\nmyself will be a supper for worms one day” (151). Hiccup doesn’t really win the battle of words to\ndismantle this  similarity, but he does successfully avoid becoming consumed by the dragon by\ntiring him out with words. In his later encounter with the same giant dragon, Hiccup confronts his\nsimilarity to dragonkind more profoundly. After landing inside the giant dragon’s mouth, he finds\nthe dragon getting inside of him: “The terrible noise of the Dragon’s heart beating had entered into\nHiccup’s chest and forced his own heart to follow the same rhythm” (188-9). Hiccup finds himself\nblending into the dragon and losing his identity and willpower due to the dragon’s digestive powers.\nThis is a literal rendering of the threat to the identity of the Germanic hero during the dragon battle.\nJust as Tolkien’s Smaug invades Bilbo’s mind through manipulative language about the dwarves,\nthe sea dragon threatens to invade Hiccup’s mind to merge them into one being. Beforehand, the sea\ndragon and Hiccup were uncanny doubles because they each are thinking, speaking beings. At the\nmoment that Hiccup hangs within the dragon’s mouth, the hero and dragon nearly move beyond to\nbecome the same creature. The uncanny is the threat of this merge, the warning to stay away. By\nreturning   intact   as   his   own   person,   Hiccup   conquers   the   dragon   psychologically   before   it   is\nphysically   defeated.   He   resists   the   transformation   and   escapes,   having   defined   himself   by   the\nwillpower to live as the hero and the human.\n\nThe  book  resolves   when  the  same   difference   is   established   on  the  side   of  the  dragons.\nToothless, after his heroism in rescuing Hiccup, is the first dragon to receive a human Viking burial.\nHiccup, given his recent conquest over the dragon-assimiliation, does not approve of this complete\nblending. He has learned that dragons are different from humans in key ways and that bridging the\ngap is fine, but removing it is not. Because of this insight, Hiccup knows that treating Toothless as\ndead by human standards  is inappropriate for he has not yet met dragon standards of death (a\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n49\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nThe Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature\n\ndragon will sing at and after its own death). Toothless learns to distinguish between bridging and\nmerging too. Toothless tells himself, “Dragons are S-S-SELFISH . . . Dragons are heartless and\nhave no mercy,” even as he flies to the rescue of Hiccup and risks his own life (192). Despite this\nflouting of dragon rules, he does not entirely change. The final page features an illustration wherein\nToothless amends his statement “Dragons are never grateful” by scratching out the word “never”\nand replacing it with “hardly ever” (214). Hiccup and Toothless ultimately both acknowledge the\nsimilarity between dragons and humans, as well as its benefits, and come out as heroes because they\nretain the differences too. In this way the book nearly addresses the uncanny nature of dragons head\non   by   dealing   with   the   troublesome   line   between   them,   as   is   primarily   demonstrated   through\nlanguage. The protagonist boy and dragon both learn to define themselves individually rather than\npurely through antagonism and fear of each other as doubles.\n\nHush, Little Dragon\n\nIn Hush, Little Dragon, the dragons’ eyes and language infuse a relatively simple picture book with\nthe uncanny. In this book, a mother dragon sings her baby to sleep with a modified version of\n“Hush, Little Baby.” Instead of various gifts or pets, the dragon brings her baby various medieval\npersons for bedtime snacks. Eyes and language figure into this story subtly through the actual form\nof the book. The format itself is important because picture books were the specific subjects of\nShastri’s dissertation and Hanlon’s later study, but in this case the function of picture book also\nfacilitates the uncanny due to the dual audience. The format itself implies a parent reading out loud\nwhile a pre-literate child listens and observes the pictures. Nodelman does a particularly thorough\njob of exploring the commonly recognized duality inherent in picture books and “the relationship of\nan   implied   adult   narrator   to   an   implied   nonadult   narratee”   (444).   As   Nodelman   notes,   this\nrelationship   implies   “an   accompanying   and   paradoxical   sense   of   a   double   addressee,   both   an\nimplied child reader and an implied adult reader who chooses or shares the texts with the implied\nchild; a focus on binary opposites like child and adult, home and away, good and evil, in theme and\nstructure”   (444).   Therefore,   for   my   purposes   here,   it   is   significant   to   note   that   the   parent   is\nperforming the language, the pre-literate child the eyes, and picture books already encourage a\nbinary between these two age extremes. This dual performance brings the characteristics of the\ndragon uncomfortably close to home by doubling not only the people with the dragons but also the\nparent/child with one another.\n\nAdults and children are doubled and divided by the very practice in which they engage\nthrough picture books: literacy. John Morgenstern points out ever since children and adults were\nseparated by the rise of schooling and the Victorian Cult of Childhood, children have been regarded\nby adults  as  another type of being that is  simultaneously the same and different, innocent and\nbarbaric (21-22). In Hush, Little Dragon, the parent and child readers each absorb the mother and\nchild dragon identities, simultaneously taking on the dragon-humanity doubling and this cultural\nOthering between adults and children over the practice of reading.\n\nAs the performers of language, the reading parent becomes the mother dragon. Ashburn\nwrites the book in the voice of the dragon mother. The book begins immediately with the lullaby\nwords: “Hush, little dragon, don’t make a sound” (Ashburn 1). The parent reading or singing this\nlullaby out loud does not read any framing words like “The mother dragon is singing,” but rather\nimmediately joins in with the mother dragon. The sing-song rhythm of the text and the well-known\ntune that it corresponds with encourage the parent to actually sing the words and perform as the\nmother dragon. The goals of the mother dragon and parents even match, as parents traditionally\nread picture books to children at bedtime. Not only does this performance make the parent into the\nmother dragon from the child listener’s point of view, but it also transforms the child into a dragon\n\n50\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nISSN: 2342-2009\n\nFafnir vol 1, iss 2, pages 41–54\n\nbaby from the parent’s point of view. Each is temporarily transformed into a dragon in the other’s\nperspective through the performative language.\n\nMeanwhile the child and parent each see a different book; one focuses on observing the\nillustrations while the other focuses on reading the words. Of course both will notice the other\naspect, but their expertise is distinctly divided. Picture book criticism has shown that children are\ngenerally more attentive to the images in books than adult readers and will catch many details while\nthe parents remain focused on the words. In a study in which children were interviewed about how\nthey read books, Arizpe and Styles affirmed that even the older children noticed less than the young\n(192). They explain this division as a “learning function” on the part of the children, thus “children\nnotice more details than adults do” (193). Children and adults’ areas of expertise further divide them\ninto the eyes and language, accordingly.\n\nHence, adults may read a more lighthearted book than the children, for within the visual\ndetails of this  book lie the most menacing parts. For instance, one spread portrays the mother\ndragon facing three musketeers. The words simply sing, “If those musketeers should bolt, / Mama’s\ngonna stop their silly revolt”  (Ashburn 15). The words may refer to stopping the musketeers, but\nwithout much menace. The use of the word “silly” belittles their need to run away at all. The\nslightly forced use of the word “revolt” to rhyme with “bolt” implies more of a political maneuver\nthan a dragon fight. In this way, the sing-song, rhyming style and somewhat absurd diction help\ndampen any potential scariness in the words.\n\nIn the picture, meanwhile, the musketeers cower against a wall as the dragon looms across\nthe opposite page. The mother dragon is so large in comparison that she is not contained within the\nframe of the spread, creating a character menacing in pure size. Additionally, her position reveals an\nanimal threat to the musketeers as she puts forward her head and bares her teeth. In the case of a\ndragon, this is also a threat of fire. Meanwhile, the baby dragon gleefully reaches for the terrified\nmusketeers. No consumption is shown in the picture, but the next page features a little musketeer\nhat on the ground between the mother and the baby, with no owner in sight. Several pages later, one\nlonely musketeer stands on the top of a tower as the mother and son fly away. The book never\nshows the baby actually eating these people, and it would be easy to assume that they are all getting\naway if it weren’t for these little visual details underscoring their fate. As the child watches the\npictures, where the people being threatened appear terrified or angry, the parent reads light, absurd\nwords and rhymes. Only at the end when the mother sings that the baby’s “tummy is full you must\nbe done!” (Ashburn 23) do the words affirm that the baby really has been consuming many of the\npeople. Effectively, the child in this situation would experience being cheerfully sung to while\nseveral people die but at the same time, the child is being addressed in second person as though he\nor she was the baby dragon. The dragons become more familiar than the humans, and in the end this\nfamiliarity creates a question of alliance and identity. While the eyes of the dragons or even the\nreaders  are not being threatened, as  in the traditional uncanny, the collective visual and verbal\ninformation which the child collects is in its own way threatening to human bodies and identities.\nThe child is given an uncertain doubling between dragon and human that brings up the question of\nwhich the child truly is or, perhaps more importantly, wishes to be.\n\nAshburn’s rhyming lyrics and Murphy’s illustrations present the dragon as uncanny, but in a\ndelightful fashion. The end result of this is not fear, but rather amusement.  Hush, Little Dragon\nfollows Grahame’s tradition of keeping the menace subtle and beneath a pleasant surface. Even\nthough the pictures imply several murders, the dragons are not terrifying. Their pleasantly rounded\nand curvy bodies appear cuddly, especially next to the generally angular and uncomfortable looking\nhumans. In the spread with the musketeers, the mother dragon may be threatening them, but her\nteeth, horns, spikes, and other scary features are curvy in stark contrast to the musketeers’ pointy\ntunics, mustaches, hats, and swords. The disparity comes off as funny, of course, but also creepy as\nit once again aligns the readers’ sympathy with the dragons.\n\n© 2014 Fafnir – Nordic Journal of Science Fiction and Fantasy Research (http://journal.finfar.org)\n\n51\n\n\fEmily Midkiff\n\nThe Uncanny Dragons of Children’s Literature\n\nHush, Little Dragon relies on form to reveal the uncanny in part due to the constraints and\nstrengths of its genre as a picture book. The chapter book How to Train Your Dragon Book 1 has\nfewer such format-based codes to manipulate, and so the uncanny occurs in the words. Through\ndifferent means, the texts  mask the uncanny with humor and satire of traditional dragons. The\nuncanny is present, a lurking dark side to dragons, but they are allowed to be funny and retain their\nfearsome power simultaneously.\n\nConclusion\n\nBetween   the  lighthearted  dragon-lore  attitude   attributed   to  Grahame   and  the   identity-disturbing\naspects translated by Tolkien, dragons in literature still have access to their mythic capabilities.\nStein, Blount, Shastri and Hanlon put the awe-inspiring aspects of mythical dragons into opposition\nwith the humorous qualities of many children’s literature dragons, yet humor and the uncanny need\nnot negate each other. Grahame’s style of humor may be just the right protective camouflage for\nTolkien-esque fearsome dragons. Using seemingly innocent traits such as eyes and language, some\nauthors sneak in the old power of dragons, whether or not they are even aware of the traditions that\nthey uphold. Dragons in modern children’s literature can still inspire the fear of the uncanny double,\nthe   uneasy   proximity   of   another   being   that   could   eclipse   oneself,   carried   from   their   ancestral\ndragon-lore. While not all take advantage of this option, and plenty of empty neighbor-dragons exist\nin children’s literature, it is important to remember that not all of those dragons may be as innocent\nas appearances would imply. A little riddling talk might bring out an entirely different (but eerily\nsimilar) beast.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nArizpe, Evelyn and Morag Styles.  Children Reading Pictures: Interpreting Visual Texts.
