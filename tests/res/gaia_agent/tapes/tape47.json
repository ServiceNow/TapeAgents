Kuznetzov from Vietnam and deposited in the\nZoological Institute, St. Petersburg\nby\nSvetlana V. nedoshivina\nreceived 4.XII.2009\n\nAbstract: 67 species described by V. Kuznetzov from Vietnam are listed with short comments on the type series including descrip-\ntions of their labels. Colour images of the holotypes are given (col. pl. 7-9). Descriptions of ‡‡ of five species are provided and their\ngenitalia are figured.\n\nZusammenfassung: 67 Arten die von V. Kuznetzov aus Vietnam beschrieben wurden, werden mit kurzen Kommentaren zur Ty-\npusserie und deren Etikettierung versehen. Die Holotypen werden farbig abgebildet (col. pl. 7-9). Von fünf Arten werden die ‡‡\nbeschrieben und deren Genitalien abgebildet.\n\nIntroduction: Vladimir ivanovich Kuznetzov (1929-2008) (figs 1-5) is one of the most famous modern Russian lepidopterologists.\nHe was born 28.II.1929 in Kingisepp, Leningrad Region. His father was née Egorov and he was born into the family of a smith.\nTherefore he was known at school as a smith’s son, in Russian transcription as Kuznetzov (=Kuznetz’s son). Thus, the family name\nKuznetzov is in some sense a pseudonym. During The Second World War Kuznetzov lost his mother and lived in an orphanage\nuntil his father came back from the War. After that, Vladimir Kuznetzov finished secondary school in Leningrad and entered the\nbiological faculty of Leningrad State University in 1946. He finished there in 1951 and completed his PhD in 1954. In 1955 Kuz-\nnetzov became a staff member at the Zoological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Leningrad, Russia (ZISP) where\nhe worked for 52 years. He took part in several expeditions and published more than 200 papers devoted to Lepidoptera, especially\nTortricidae. Most of his works dealt with the Palaearctic fauna, but some of them were based on material from the Oriental Regi-\non. In total, Kuznetzov described 394 taxa, 295 of them Tortricidae. He died 22.VIII 2008 in St. Petersburg and was cremated at\nSmolenskoe Cemetery.\n\nTwice in his lifetime, in 1986 and 1988, Kuznetzov visited Vietnam as a member of Soviet-Vietnamese zoological expeditions.\nThe first field trip was carried out in spring and all material was collected in the Northern provinces: Son La, Vinh Phuc and Thái\nNguyên (earlier Bắc Thái). The second trip was in autumn (9.XI.-22.XII.) and during this time Kuznetzov visited the south of the\ncountry in the Gia Lai (earlier Gia Lai-Kon Tum) province. A huge amount of lepidopterous material was collected by Kuznetzov\nin Vietnam and all of it is now deposited in the collection of ZISP. As a result of his expeditionary work, Kuznetzov published 13\npapers devoted to Tortricidae of Vietnam but only one of them was in English. In these works he listed 225 species, described 67 of\nthem as new, and established 5 new genera.\n\nInvestigation of the type material is an important part of all taxonomic studies but detailed descriptions of the species, with figured\ngenitalia of both sexes and coloured images of the moths, make the work much easier. Descriptions of Tortricidae from Vietnam\npublished by Kuznetzov in 1988-2003 are quite full and figures of genitalia structures are very good. Unfortunately, he gave no\nphotos of the type specimens and all his descriptions were published in Russian. So the work with Kuznetzov’s papers is very com-\nplicated without knowledge of the Russian language.\n\nIn recent years the volume of newly collected material from South-East Asia has really increased; a lot of new species are described\nrecently from this region. At the same time, coloured images are very important for the comparison of new material with the species\nalready described to avoid making synonyms. Since Kuznetzov’s types have never been examined by other workers, almost all of them\nare placed now in the same genera as in the original description. Very few of them were synonymized and mentioned by other workers\nat all. The reason is probably the difficulty in interpreting species described by Kuznetzov without images. Another problem is that\nsome species were described by Kuznetzov based on a single specimen, in most cases †, and ‡‡ are unknown.\n\nAll Vietnamese Tortricidae collected by Kuznetzov were arranged taxonomically within the main collection of ZISP. Each speci-\nmen has a standard white printed label with the name of the locality (in English). Most of them have a label with the name of the\nspecies written in ink by Kuznetzov’s hand. All type specimens kept in the main collection have a red label with printed text “Ho-\nlotypus” or “Paratypus” and the name of the species written in ink by Kuznetzov’s hand. Kuznetzov never made genitalia slides\nand all genitalia preparations are mounted with sugar on the paper plates and put on the species needles under the locality labels.\nSurprisingly, types of several species described by Kuznetzov were not found in the main collection. However, three drawers of\nVietnamese Tortricidae were found in the cabinet where Kuznetzov deposited all material he currently worked on. Some of those\nTortricidae were determined by him and marked with the species name on a label. Others are undetermined or bear handwritten\nlabels with the name of the genus or different comments (in Russian). All missing types were found in these drawers, but only a few\nof them were marked with red type labels. So specimens belong to the type series were discovered by comparison of their labels with\nthe original descriptions. Names of localities mentioned on Kuznetzov’s labels often differ from modern names and in some cases it\nis difficult to find them on the map. Therefore the list of collecting localities by Kuznetzov is given below with notes on real names\nand coordinates of corresponding places.\n\n1. Prov. Sonla, Naniu - According to the map published by Kuznetzov in 2000, this locality is situated between 22º 07‘ and 22º\n11‘ N, 102º 59‘ and 103º 09‘ E. Probably this point on the map was identified by Kuznetzov inexactly and actually corres-\nponds to Bản Nắm Nhié situated at 22º 08‘ N, 102º 45‘ E.\n\n2. Prov. Sonla, Chiengkhouan or Chienghouan - Province Son La, Bản Chiêng Khoang, 21º 33‘ N, 103º 40‘ E.\n\n335\n\n\fPlate 1: (1) vladimir ivanovich Kuznetzov nearly in 1950th.

The abdomen of the specimen was removed and there was neither genitalia preparation nor a number of the genitalia slide on\nthe specimen’s pin or elsewhere in the drawer. So the genitalia of the specimen were probably lost.

Comparison of the original description of G. nielseni\nKawabe and the holotype of G. blanditana Kuzn. confirms that Griselda nielseni Kawabe should be considered as a junior synonym\nof G. blanditana Kuzn. Brown et al. (2005) placed G. blanditana Kuzn. in the group “Eucosmini unplaced species” with a reference\n“Although described in Griselda (now considered a synonym of Epinotia), blanditana Kuzn. does not belong in Epinotia because it\nlacks the cleft or divided uncus typical of the genus (R. Brown)” (Brown et al., 2005: 740). However, in 2000, Kuznetzov transfer-\nred blanditana to Rhopobota and this combination is accepted here.\nDistribution: Vietnam: Tam Dảo; Thailand (Kuznetzov, 2000).\n19.\nGrapholita comanticosta Kuznetzov, 1988, Trudy zoologicheskogo Instituta, Leningrad, 176: 94, fig. 35.\nTypes: Holotype †, N.

Although Kuznetzov designa-\nted 10 ‡‡ from Tam Dảo as paratypes, only 6 of them were found in the collection of ZISP. Besides that, 2 ††, 2 ‡‡ were mentioned\nby Kuznetzov from Hanoi but actually 3 ††, 1 ‡ of them are present in the collection.\nTaxonomic notes: The species was described in the genus Grapholita but in 1992 it was transferred without any discussion to the\ngenus Cydia by Razowski. However, his opinion was ignored by later revisers (e.g. Kuznetzov, 2000; Brown et al., 2005). In this\nwork I follow the opinion by Kuznetzov and treat the species in Grapholita.

Gialai, Tramlap, 20 km N Buenluoi, 900 m, 26.XI.1988, V. Kuznetzov leg.\nComments: The ‡ is still unknown. The holotype was not found in the main collection of ZISP, but in the drawer with Kuznetzov’s\nmaterial was one specimen collected 26.XI.1988 in Tram Lap. This specimen bears Kuznetzov’s handwritten white label “не ab-\nrupta и не hapalanta” [not abrupta and not hapalanta]. On the other side of this label Kuznetzov wrote: “Semniotes hapalantoides\nKuzn. sp. n., holotype”. Probably “hapalanta” is the incorrect name of Semniotes halantha Meyrick, 1909. At the same time, in the\noriginal description Kuznetzov mentioned that the narrow valva of S. confinana Kuzn. differs from those of S. halantha Meyrick,\n1909 and S. abrupta Diakonoff, 1973 (Kuznetzov, 2003: 729). The genitalia of the single specimen completely correspond with the\noriginal description of S. confinana Kuzn. Thus, in spite of the specimen was marked by Kuznetzov as hapalantoides, it was consi-\ndered to be a holotype of confinana and marked by me with a red printed label: “HOLOTYPUS, Semniotes confinana Kuznetzov,\n2003”.

So it was considered to be a holotype of dentiuncana and marked by me with a red printed label: “HOLOTYPUS,\nDrachmobola dentiuncana Kuznetzov, 2003”.

The descriptions of the ‡ genitalia of S. diakonoffi Kuzn. are given below in the Taxo-\nnomic appendix for the first time.\nTaxonomic notes: Characters of forewing pattern and coloration are very similar to those of Statherotis ?amaeboea (Lower, 1896) on the\nphotograph in Horak, 2006: 192, fig. 394. However, she noted that the identity of this Australian species has generally been misconstrued\nbecause it was based on the series of specimens from New Guinea determined by Meyrick and not on Lower’s type.

During our study\nwe collected a series of specimens at the Mê Linh biological station (North Vietnam, Vinh Phuc Prov., Ngoc Thanh vill.) which\ncompletely corresponded to the description and the figure by Kuznetzov (1997: Plate 2, fig. 12a), except for a strong bundle formed\nby long and slender cornuti in the vesica. Their length is approximately as the length of the aedeagus (Plate 2, fig. 12b). Therefore\nthe cornuti in the genitalia of the holotype were probably lost during preparation of the genitalia.\nThe original description was based on a single † specimen; the ‡ is unknown. In the series of specimens from Mê Linh several ‡‡\nclearly correspond to the †† of D. fumidana Kuzn. They are therefore considered as ‡‡ of this species.

Unfortunately, a paratype was not found in the collection of ZISP.\nTaxonomic notes: Described in Grapholita but Razowski (1992) transferred the species to Cydia. However, his opinion was ignored by\nlater revisers (e.g. Kuznetzov, 2000; Brown et al., 2005). At the same time Kuznetzov (2000) synonymized the taxon with Grapholita\nseclusana (Walker, 1866).\nDistribution: Vietnam: Tam Dảo; Indonesia; New Guinea (KUuznetzov, 2000).\n43.\nAsymmetrarcha metallicana Kuznetzov, 1992, Entomologicheskoe Obozrenie 71 (4): 858, fig. 16.\nTypes: Holotype †, S.

Kuznetzov leg.\nPresent status: Thaumatotibia meridiana (Kuznetzov, 1992)\nComments: The † of this species is described in the same paper by Kuznetzov (1992a: 854, fig. 8). In the original description, the legends\nto figures 8 and 9 were confused: fig. 8 was named as Leguminivora meridiana sp. n., †, holotype and fig. 9 was named as the same\nspecies, ‡, paratype. Actually the holotype ‡ was figured on fig. 9 and the paratype † was on the fig. 8. The holotype ‡ is in very poor\ncondition. Probably it was damaged by dermestid beetles and only 2 forewings glued to the paper plate are present. The paratype †\nwas destroyed by dermestid beetles entirely and only the genitalia preparation of it exists in the collection.\nTaxonomic notes: The species was described in the genus Leguminivora but in his list of Vietnamese Tortricidae Kuznetzov (2000)\nmentioned it in Metriophlebia. Brown et al. (2005) treated Metriophlebia as a junior synonym of Thaumatotibia, but, at the same\ntime, listed meridiana in Leguminivora. We follow Kuznetzov (2000) and place meridiana in Thaumatotibia.\n\nmica Kuznetzov, 1988 (colour plate 8: 24)\n\n45.\nHerpystis mica Kuznetzov, 1988, Entomologicheskoe Obozrenie 67 (3): 630, fig. 22.\nTypes: Holotype †, N.

Unfortunately, the holotype was entirely destroyed by dermestid beetles, only the\ngenitalia preparation of it was kept safe. In the collection of ZISP there is one other specimen determined by Kuznetzov as Her-\npystis mica Kuzn. This specimen was collected in Tam Dảo, 11.IV.1986, and was not included in the type series. However, probably\nafter destroying the holotype, Kuznetzov marked this non-type species with a handwritten red label “Topotypus, Herpystis mica\nKuzn.” This specimen is figured here on colour plate 8: 24.\nKuznetzov (2000) mentioned that H. mica Kuzn. was collected also in Tram Lap, 22.XI.1988.

Razowski (1992) transferred it into the genus Cydia, but\nhis opinion was ignored by later revisers (e.g. Kuznetzov, 2000; Brown et al., 2005). In this work we follow the opinion by Kuznet-\nzov and treat valens in Grapholita. Distribution: Known only from the type locality.\n\nTaxonomic appendix\n\nStatherotis diakonoffi Kuznetzov, 1988\nDescription of ‡: Forewing length 9 mm. Fore- and hindwing coloration are similar to the †.\nGenitalia (plate 2: 9-10): Papillae anales subtriangular. Apophyses posteriores and apophyses anteriores approximately similar in\nlength. Sterigma sclerotized and form two processes perpendicular to the plane of sterigma. Distal ends of processes are rounded.\nUpper margin of sterigma form a short conical prominence. Colliculum long and bipartite, similar or somewhat shorter than ster-\nnum 7.  Ductus bursae long and narrow, corpus bursae ovate. Two strong signa formed by dense rows of pectination of increasing\nsize. One signum is somewhat smaller than another. Signa size is a little variable. Form of signa is rather elongated.\nComments: In the original description Kuznetzov mentioned that, based on † genitalia, S. diakonoffi Kuzn. is close to S. discana\n(Felder & Rogenhofer, 1874) and S. discana f. saturata Diakonoff, 1973, an infrasubspecific taxon. The ‡ genitalia also shows\nclose relations but differs from S. discana (Felder & Rogenhofer) with the following characters: conical prominence on the upper\nmargin of sterigma, signa of elongated form, whereas in S. discana (Felder & Rogenhofer) sterigma flattened, signa rather roun-\nded (Diakonoff, 1973: 244-245). The description given by Diakonoff for saturata does not correspond completely to the ‡ of S.\ndiakonoffi Kuzn.: sterigma aciculate, upper angles extended and pointed (Diakonoff, 1973: 246, fig. 355).\nMaterial: 2 ‡‡, N. Vietnam, prov. Sonla, Chiengkhouan, 13.V.1986, V. Kuznetzov leg. GS. SVN09060.\n\nDicnecidia fumidana Kuznetzov, 1997\nDescription of ‡: Forewing length 7-8 mm. Forewing coloration does not differ from the †.\nGenitalia (plate 2: 6): Papillae anales elongate, with constricted lower part. Antrum weakly sclerotized, wide, shallow, cup-shaped.\nCingulum fairly long, looks like a plate turned over ductus bursae, forming a non-closed tube with a free space on the dorsal side.\nSternum 7 wide with large rounded prominences of the lateral margins. Ductus bursae wide and corpus bursae large with two fal-\ncated signa on a rounded base.\nComments: The genus Dicnecidia includes two species: D. cataclasta Diakonoff, 1982 and D. fumidana Kuzn. Diakonoff descri-\nbed cataclasta based on a single † species. Unfortunately I cannot find a description of the ‡ of this species. Probably the ‡ is not\ndescribed yet.\nMaterial: 4 ‡‡, N.

Characters of forewing pattern and coloration are the same as in the † but the brown spot\non the hindwing is somewhat larger.\nGenitalia (plate 2: 8): Papillae anales elongate. Apophyses posteriores slender and about 1.5 times shorter than apophyses anteri-\nores. Sterigma membraneous and ostium bursae indistinct. Sternum 7 small, with a deep cavity on the distal margin. Colliculum\nsmall, narrow and ring-shaped with a deep cavity on its hind side. Ductus bursae long and wide. Corpus bursae small, at least 1.5\ntimes as wide as the ductus bursae. Single signum small, rounded and concave to the corpus bursae.\nComments: The genus Cimeliomorpha includes three species: C. cymbalora (Meyrick, 1907), C. egregiana (Felder & Rogenhofer,\n1875) and C. nabokovi Kuznetzov, 1997. The ‡ of C. nabokovi Kuzn. shows close relation to C. cymbalora (Meyrick) (plate 2: 7)\nbut differs from it by indistinct ostium bursae, shape of  sternum 7 and colliculum, wide ductus bursae, size of corpus bursae, size\nand shape of single signum. All these features additionally confirm the status of C. nabokovi Kuzn. as bona species.\nMaterial: 1 ‡, C. Vietnam, Thua Thien Hue Prov., A Ruang, h=663m, 16º04‘ N, 107º29‘ E, 24.-27.IV.2009, S.

Coloration of the fore- and hindwings as in the †.\nGenitalia (plate 2: 12).: Papillae anales subtriangular with distinct corners. Sterigma ring-shaped, ostium ovoid, narrow, dilated\nventrally. Antrum converse cone-shaped, well sclerotized. Ductus bursae forms two spiral introversions, with short plate-shaped\ncestum. Corpus bursae ovoid, hook-like signum with elongate rounded base.\nComments: As very few species of Neocalyptis have ‡‡ figured and described in literature, it is difficult to give a differential diagnosis\nfor the N. sodaliana Kuzn. ‡.\nMaterial:  Paratypes  2  ‡‡,  S.  Vietnam,  prov.  Gialai-Kontum,  Tramlap,  20  km  N  Buenluoi,  30.XI.1988,  V.  Kuznetzov  leg.  GS.\nSVN09061.\n\nHomona superbana Kuznetzov, 1992\nDescription of ‡: Forewing length 12 mm. Main colour of the forewings light pale with two indistinct light brown stripes. Colour of\n\n346\n\n\fthe hindwings orange yellowish with brown edges and fringe.\nGenitalia (plate 2: 13): Papillae anales elongate, covered by short hairs. Ostium broad, sterigma cup-shaped.  Antrum membraneous\nbearing sclerotized plate under ostium and ductus bursae long, broad cestum with dilated, rounded proximal end. Corpus bursae\novoid, signum as large hook, with obtuse top and large oval base.\nComments: In the original description Kuznetzov noted that this species is closely related to Homona coffearia (Nietner, 1861).\nAccording to the ‡ genitalia this relationship is clear but H. superbana Kuzn. distinctly differs from H. coffearia (Diakonoff, 1939:\n141, fig. A) with the following characters: cestum broader, dilated almost twice in proximal end, presence of sclerotized plate in\nantrum, antrum deeper, no prominences on ventral sides. Signum top not pointed, its base broader.\nMaterial:  Paratype  ‡,  S.  Vietnam,  prov.  Gialai-Kontum,  Tramlap,  20  km  N  Buenluoi,  30.XI.1988,  V.  Kuznetzov  leg.
