However, could this remarkable run reverse, and the stock fall by over 50% from current levels? It’s a real possibility. At the current market price of $140, Nvidia trades at over 80x trailing earnings and 50x projected FY’25 earnings. These multiples seem elevated, but they sure are supported by the company’s recent high growth rates as Nvidia has been witnessing booming demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs), which have become the go\\-to silicon for artificial intelligence applications.\n\nHowever, stock markets often extrapolate short\\-term trends into the long run. For another stock that has been volatile recently see [Is Super Micro Stock A Buy Now?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/11/20/super-micros-compliance-plan-is-the-stock-a-buy/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/11/20/super-micros-compliance-plan-is-the-stock-a-buy/\") In Nvidia’s case, the price likely assumes that demand growth, pricing power, and profits for Nvidia’s accelerators will remain robust as the generative AI wave holds up. Yet, there are significant risks to this assumption, making a sizable correction a real possibility. The broader economic environment adds another layer of uncertainty. While markets have rallied following the election of Donald Trump, the risk of inflation persists amid threats of tariffs and deportation policies. These factors could impact the interest rate environment and, in turn, the valuation of high\\-growth stocks like Nvidia. ([S\\&P To Crash More Than 40%?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/11/18/sp-to-crash-more-than-40/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/11/18/sp-to-crash-more-than-40/\")) We present this downside as a counter to our analysis of [Nvidia’s upside to $300](https://www.trefis.com/stock/nvda/articles/558174/how-nvidia-stock-could-jump-2-5x-to-reach-300/2024-08-28?from=nvidia_downside \"https://www.trefis.com/stock/nvda/articles/558174/how-nvidia-stock-could-jump-2-5x-to-reach-300/2024-08-28?from=nvidia_downside\"). Indeed we believe this broad range of upside and downside potential represents a simple fact: Nvidia is a volatile stock.\n\n**How Volatile Has Nvidia Stock Been?**\n\nWhile NVDA stock swelled over 10x from levels of $13 in early January 2021 to around $140 now, vs. an increase of about 50% for the S\\&P 500 over this roughly 4\\-year period. It was a bumpy ride, with returns for the stock being 125% in 2021, \\-50% in 2022, and 239% in 2023\\. The underperformance in NVDA’s stock vs. the S\\&P 500 in 2022 stands out in particular \\- as the benchmark index had returns of \\-19% that year, compared to a 50% drawdown for Nvidia. Notably, the Trefis [High Quality Portfolio](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/PORTFOLIOS/no-login-required/RsQ6oXgC/High-Quality-Portfolio-30-Stocks-with-210-Return-Since-2016-vs-94-for-S-P-500?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50 \"https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/PORTFOLIOS/no-login-required/RsQ6oXgC/High-Quality-Portfolio-30-Stocks-with-210-Return-Since-2016-vs-94-for-S-P-500?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50\"), with a collection of 30 stocks, has **outperformed the S\\&P 500 each year** over the same period. **Why is that?** As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller\\-coaster ride as evident in [HQ Portfolio performance metrics](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/PORTFOLIOS/no-login-required/37ZjifdJ/High-Quality-Portfolio-Fact-Sheet?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50 \"https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/PORTFOLIOS/no-login-required/37ZjifdJ/High-Quality-Portfolio-Fact-Sheet?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50\").\n\n**Nvidia’s Growth Rates Could Cool Off**\n\nNvidia’s sales have grown at a breakneck pace. [Nvidia’s revenues](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/NVDA/no-login-required/1eZgttoo/Nvidia-Revenues-How-Does-NVDA-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50 \"https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/NVDA/no-login-required/1eZgttoo/Nvidia-Revenues-How-Does-NVDA-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50\") were up by close to 3x over the last 12 months as companies doubled down on accelerated computing using GPUs to perform more artificial intelligence tasks. However, there is a possibility that growth could cool considerably or potentially even flatline.\n\n***Why?***\n\nThe underlying economics of the end market for GPU chips and the broader AI ecosystem are weak, and most of Nvidia’s customers remain loss\\-making. Large language models are very expensive to build and train. VC firm Sequoia estimated that the AI industry spent $50 billion on Nvidia chips last year, and the total could exceed $100 billion when including ancillary investments. Despite this, these investments have only generated about $3 billion in revenue, with few AI services besides ChatGPT gaining a large base of paying customers. We could very well be in a phase where companies are seeing so\\-called FOMO, compelling them to invest in AI just because their rivals are doing so, without a thought about the return on investments. As shareholders seek better returns, we could see capital spending cool off, impacting the likes of Nvidia. The macro environment might also play spoilsport. The Fed all but finalized last week that rates are unlikely to be cut in the Fed’s December meeting amid concerns about inflation. Elevated interest rates could further compound the weak payback equation for AI GPUs.\n\nMORE FROM[FORBES VETTED](https://www.forbes.com/vetted/ \"https://www.forbes.com/vetted/\")[### Save Up To 75% With The Best Black Friday Clothing Deals That Are Still Running](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2024/12/01/black-friday-clothing-deals/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2024/12/01/black-friday-clothing-deals/\")[ByJordan ThomasForbes Staff](https://www.forbes.comhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/people/jordanthomas/ \"https://www.forbes.comhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/people/jordanthomas/\")[### 10 Unofficial Hoka Cyber Week Sales You Don’t Want To Miss](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2024/12/01/hoka-black-friday-sale/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2024/12/01/hoka-black-friday-sale/\")[ByAlexandra PolkContributor](https://www.forbes.comhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/people/alexandrapolk/ \"https://www.forbes.comhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/people/alexandrapolk/\")\nSeparately, large AI deployments have two stages: the compute\\-intensive training phase, which drives Nvidia’s current demand, and the deployment phase, where trained models are used in real\\-world applications with lower power requirements. Most companies are going through the compute\\-intensive training phase at the moment, and there’s a real possibility that demand for GPUs could cool off once these companies move to the deployment phase.\n\nEven if demand for Nvidia’s products remains strong, growth could face challenges on account of supply constraints or execution issues. Nvidia has adopted a timeline of releasing a new AI chip series annually, which increases the risk of missteps. For instance, Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chip faced certain design flaws which delayed its release by a quarter. Although these issues were eventually resolved, a recent report by The Information indicates that the chip is now overheating when used with certain customized server racks. While Nvidia is reportedly working with its suppliers to redesign these racks to address the problem, the incident highlights the risks associated with Nvidia’s aggressive development schedule. Moreover, Nvidia relies almost entirely on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for GPU production. This dependency could introduce further bottlenecks, as TSMC’s production timelines may not align with Nvidia’s ambitions. While Nvidia aims to launch a new AI chip every year, TSMC requires at least 18 months to set up new manufacturing facilities, according to The Economist. A potential misalignment between Nvidia’s goals and TSMC’s production capabilities could constrain Nvidia’s ability to meet demand effectively.\n\nNow, [Nvidia’s revenues](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/NVDA/no-login-required/1eZgttoo/Nvidia-Revenues-How-Does-NVDA-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50 \"https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/NVDA/no-login-required/1eZgttoo/Nvidia-Revenues-How-Does-NVDA-Make-Money-?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50\") are on track to more than double this year to about $126 billion per consensus estimates. However, if its growth rates slow considerably from here on to just about 15% over the next two years due to the aforementioned factors, sales could see a much more subdued move from around $61 billion in FY’24 to about $166 billion in FY’27\\.\n\n**Nvidia’s Margins Could Be At Risk**\n\nNvidia’s margins (net income, or profits after all expenses and taxes, calculated as a percent of revenues) have been expanding \\- they grew from levels of about 25% in FY’19 to about 49% in FY’24 as the company witnessed better economies of scale and a more favorable product mix skewed toward complex data center products. Our dashboard has more details about the various components responsible for [**Nvidia’s net income change.**](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/NVDA/no-login-required/ZAAYE2tV/What-Drove-the-581-3-Net-Income-Change-for-NVIDIA-in-FY2024-?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50 \"https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/NVDA/no-login-required/ZAAYE2tV/What-Drove-the-581-3-Net-Income-Change-for-NVIDIA-in-FY2024-?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50\")\n\nHowever, there is a real possibility that margins could decline to levels of about 35%. Why is that so? Competition is mounting with other chipmakers such as AMD investing significantly to catch up in this space given the high stakes. AMD claims that its new Instinct MI300X chip outperforms Nvidia’s current chips in several parameters, while Intel is also looking to make a dent in the space with more value\\-priced AI chips. Customers are also looking for alternatives to Nvidia, as they look to better manage costs. On Monday IBM said that it was collaborating with AMD to include Instinct MI300X accelerators into its cloud offerings. Separately, big tech players like Google \\- who are among the biggest buyers of Nvidia’s GPUs \\- are doubling down on their own AI and machine learning\\-related silicon. It’s quite likely that stronger competition will make Nvidia’s current revenue growth rates and abnormally high margins unsustainable.\n\n**How Does This Impact Nvidia’s Valuation?**\n\nIf we combine 1\\.3x revenue growth (up 30%) between FY’25 and FY’27, with margins contracting from 50% levels currently to about 35% (down 30%, or 0\\.7x), this would imply that net income could decline by roughly 10% by 2027\\. Now if earnings shrink by 10%, the P/E multiple is also likely to take a hit as investors re\\-assess Nvidia’s long\\-term growth prospects. If [Nvidia’s P/E](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/NVDA/no-login-required/Ny1to52V/NVIDIA-NVDA-Valuation-Ratios-Comparison?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50 \"https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/NVDA/no-login-required/Ny1to52V/NVIDIA-NVDA-Valuation-Ratios-Comparison?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50\") gradually shrinks from a multiple of about 50x now to about 25x, this could translate into a decline in Nvidia stock by over 50% to levels of roughly $65 per share. What about the time horizon for this negative\\-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes two years or five years \\- if the competitive threat plays out and Nvidia’s GPU cash cow faces headwinds, we could see a sizable correction in Nvidia stock. (Should you [Buy, Sell, Or Hold Nvidia Stock?](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/25/buy-sell-or-hold-nvidia-stock/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/25/buy-sell-or-hold-nvidia-stock/\")) And it could be a bumpy ride yet again.\n\nWhile there is certainly a case to be made for long\\-term gains from NVDA stock, the Trefis [High Quality Portfolio](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/PORTFOLIOS/no-login-required/RsQ6oXgC/High-Quality-Portfolio-30-Stocks-with-210-Return-Since-2016-vs-94-for-S-P-500?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50 \"https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/PORTFOLIOS/no-login-required/RsQ6oXgC/High-Quality-Portfolio-30-Stocks-with-210-Return-Since-2016-vs-94-for-S-P-500?fromforbesandarticle=nvda11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50\") could be right up your alley if consistent outperformance is at the top of your list.\n\nNVDA Return Compared With Trefis Reinforced Portfolio\n\nTrefis\n\nInvest with **Trefis** [**Market Beating Portfolios**](https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/PORTFOLIOS/no-login-required/RsQ6oXgC/High-Quality-Portfolio-30-Stocks-with-211-Return-Since-2016-vs-95-for-S-P-500?fromforbesandarticle11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50-EndLinks \"https://www.trefis.com/data/companies/PORTFOLIOS/no-login-required/RsQ6oXgC/High-Quality-Portfolio-30-Stocks-with-211-Return-Since-2016-vs-95-for-S-P-500?fromforbesandarticle11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50-EndLinks\")\n\nSee all **Trefis** [**Price Estimates**](https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/price-estimates?fromforbesandarticle11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50-EndLinks \"https://dashboards.trefis.com/data/price-estimates?fromforbesandarticle11192024-could-nvidia-stock-crash-50-EndLinks\")\n\n[![Trefis Team](https://blogs-images.forbes.com/greatspeculations/files/2014/07/Trefis-Team_avatar_1404395763-400x400.png)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/people/trefis/ \"Photo of Trefis Team\")[Trefis Team](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/people/trefis/ \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/people/trefis/\")[Following](https://account.forbes.com/following \"https://account.forbes.com/following\")* [Editorial Standards](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesstaff/article/forbes-editorial-values-and-standards/)\n* [Forbes Accolades](https://www.parsintl.com/publications/forbes/)\n\n### Join The Conversation\n\nComments One Community.

the third quarter evidence the consistent execution of our two\\-pronged strategy to generate durable growth.  We continue to enhance our core through expansion of our industry\\-leading aggregates cash gross profit per ton, which increased 10 percent in the third quarter and has grown by double\\-digits for eight consecutive quarters.  We also recently announced the acquisition of Wake Stone Corporation, a leading pure\\-play aggregates producer, that will expand our reach in high\\-growth geographies in the Carolinas.  Our Vulcan Way of Selling and Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines remain fundamental to compounding profitability across our franchise and successfully integrating new operations.\"\n\n**Third Quarter Segment Results**\n\n**Aggregates**Third quarter segment gross profit was $498 million ($8\\.63 per ton), and gross profit margin expanded 40 basis points.  Cash gross profit per ton improved 10 percent to $10\\.89 per ton, despite lower shipments and harsh weather conditions throughout the quarter.  Improvements in unit profitability were widespread across the Company's footprint.\n\nAggregates shipments decreased 10 percent as compared to the prior year's third quarter.  Shipments across the Southeast were impacted by significant rainfall in July, followed by numerous hurricanes and severe storms in August and September.  The prior year's third quarter included fewer severe weather events.\n\nThe pricing environment remained positive across the footprint.  Freight\\-adjusted selling prices increased 10 percent as compared to the prior year.  Freight\\-adjusted unit cash cost of sales was negatively impacted by lower volume and challenging weather\\-affected operating conditions; freight\\-adjusted cash cost of sales dollars remained flat compared to the prior year.\n\n**Asphalt and Concrete**Asphalt segment gross profit was $60 million, and cash gross profit was $72 million, a 12 percent improvement over the prior year.  Shipments increased slightly as compared to the prior year, and price improved 6 percent.  Concrete segment gross profit was $7 million, and cash gross profit was $17 million.  The prior year's third quarter included results from the previously divested concrete assets in Texas, which accounted for the majority of the year\\-over\\-year decline in cash gross profit.\n\n**Selling, Administrative and General (SAG) and Other Items**SAG expense was $129 million compared to $144 million in the prior year's third quarter.  As a percent of total revenues, SAG expense was 6\\.4 percent and 20 basis points lower than the prior year's third quarter.\n\nThis year's third quarter included a pretax charge of $87 million ($84 million after\\-tax) resulting from the write\\-off of goodwill for the Company's concrete assets in Northern California.\n\n**Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Allocation**The Company remains well positioned for continued growth with a strong liquidity position and balance sheet profile.  As of September 30, 2024, the ratio of total debt to trailing\\-twelve months Adjusted EBITDA was 1\\.7 times and below the Company's target range of 2\\.0 to 2\\.5 times.  On a trailing\\-twelve months basis, return on invested capital improved 70 basis points over the prior year to 16\\.1 percent.\n\nCapital expenditures were $104 million in the third quarter and $402 million on a year\\-to\\-date basis.  For the full year, the Company expects to spend between $625 and $650 million for maintenance and growth projects.  During the quarter, the Company returned $61 million to shareholders through dividends, a 6 percent increase versus the prior year's third quarter.\n\nThe acquisition of Wake Stone Corporation is consistent with our disciplined capital allocation priorities and aggregates\\-led strategy of continuing to expand our reach to better serve more high\\-growth regions in the United States.  The acquisition is expected to provide more than 60 years of quality hard rock reserves.  The Company expects to close the transaction during the fourth quarter of this year, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.\n\n**Outlook**Regarding the Company's current year outlook, Mr. Hill said, \"While significant weather disruptions have impacted construction activity through the first nine months of the year, overall demand fundamentals continue to underpin long\\-term growth.  The pricing environment remains positive, and we continue to execute well.  Given the decline in shipments to date and continued weather events so far in the fourth quarter, we now expect full\\-year Adjusted EBITDA of approximately $2 billion.\n\nMr. Hill continued, \"As we look to 2025, we expect aggregates price to improve high\\-single digits, cost to benefit from our Vulcan Way of Operating disciplines and moderating inflation and, most importantly, cash gross profit per ton to continue expanding at double\\-digit levels.  A demand backdrop underpinned by growth in public construction activity and an improving private demand environment should lead to volume growth in 2025\\.  Our steadfast focus to execute at the highest level – both commercially and operationally – positions us well to capitalize on improving volume and grow earnings.\"\n\n**Conference Call**Vulcan will host a conference
