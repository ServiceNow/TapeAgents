In the 2010 film, Toothless is struck\ndown  during  a  dragon  raid  and  loses  his  left  tail-fin,  leaving  him  trapped  in  a  sunken  area.  This  paper\ninvestigates  the  feasibility  of  Hiccup,  a  teenage  boy,  being  able  to  supply  enough  fish  to  maintain  the\ndragon\u2019s diet by catching and bringing fish to him. It was found that in the twelve days that Toothless was\ntrapped, he would have required 13 Icelandic cod and 56 Atlantic salmon every day, which totalled 716 kg.\nHiccup  would  have  had  to  carry  828  fish  weighing  at  total  of  8592  kg  over  the  twelve  days,  which  is\nunrealistic since he struggles to lift a shield in combat.\n\nIntroduction\nThe  How  to  Train  Your  Dragon  franchise  is  loosely\nbased on the popular book series by Cressida Cowell\n[1]. The events take  place in  Viking  Scotland, in the\nsmall village of Berk which is repeatedly attacked by\ndragons. One of the  deadliest  dragon  species  is the\nNight Fury, which was previously unseen by any living\nperson.  It  is  described  as  the  \u201cunholy  offspring  of\nlightning  and  death  itself\u201d  due  to  its  speed  and\ncamouflage abilities [2]. Toothless is the only known\nNight Fury, and is shown to be intelligent and playful\nwhile also deadly.\n\nHiccup Horrendous Haddock III, the main protagonist,\nis  a  small  teenage  boy  eager  to  prove  himself  as  a\nViking. Using an invention which closely resembles a\nnet  gun,  Hiccup  strikes  down  Toothless  during  a\ndragon  raid.  Toothless\u2019  left  caudal  fin  is  severed,\nrendering him unable to fly out of the sunken area,\nknown as The Cove [3]. Fish are a large component of\nis  exclusively\na  dragon\u2019s  diet,  and  Toothless\ndependent  on  fish  for  nutrition  [4].  This  paper\ninvestigates  whether  Hiccup  is  able  to  maintain\nToothless\u2019 feeding habits while he is trapped in The\nCove.\n\nAssumptions\nSeveral  assumptions  and  simplifications  must  be\nmade  to  calculate  the  required  values.  During  the\ntime  lapse  montages  in  the  film,  it  is  taken  that\n\nToothless is in The Cove for a total of twelve days [5].\nIt is assumed that Hiccup visited once a day for the\nduration of Toothless\u2019 stay.\n\nOn  the  third  day,  Hiccup  brings  a  sack  of  fish,  and\nmentions that it contains Icelandic cod and salmon.\nThere  is  also  a  pond  in  the  clearing,  and  one  scene\nshows  Toothless  hunting  for  fish.  However,  in  this\npaper,  it  is  assumed  that  Toothless  relies  solely  on\nHiccup for nutrition. During his time in The Cove, it is\nassumed  that  his  diet  consists  of  only  salmon  and\ncod. It is also assumed that each sack contained the\nsame amount of fish, and that he received the same\namount every day for twelve days.\n\nThe sack is modelled as a cylinder, while the fish have\nbeen modelled as prolate spheroids (see Appendix for\nvisual aids).\n\nFigure 1 \u2013 Comparison of size of Hiccup to bag [5].\n\nSize of the bag\nHiccup is said to be 1.625 m tall [6], and using average\nmale  proportions,  the  bag  appears  to  be  3/8  of  his\nheight [7]. Therefore, the height of the bag,\n\n:\n\n\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc3b\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc4f\n\n\fCan Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon\u2019s Diet?

The bag used to\nprovide food was calculated as having a capacity of\n0.1777 m3, and could hold 56 Atlantic salmon and 13\nIcelandic cod. Hiccup would have to carry 716 kg of\nfish to The Cove every day, a total of 8592 kg over the\nperiod of twelve days. Hiccup is depicted as physically\nweak,  and  is  unable  to  even  hold  up  a  shield  for  a\nprolonged time. It is therefore concluded that Hiccup\nwould be unable to carry the bag and could not feed\nToothless  for  the  duration  of  his  time  in  The  Cove,\nunless he made several trips, used less heavy fish, or\ndidn\u2019t fully fill the sack.\n\n\fCan Hiccup Supply Enough Fish to Maintain a Dragon\u2019s Diet?
