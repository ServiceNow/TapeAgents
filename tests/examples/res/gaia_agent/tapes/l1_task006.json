Colonnades, and chambers, and\nfountains, and libraries ... All in dusty ancient stone.\n\nMoving closer over details: in every room, mounted somewhere\non the wall is a Cog Unit - a mechanical fixture that looks\nlike it could move the whole wall.\n\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n\n(V.O.)\n\nWherever you go, whatever path you\ntake, it will follow; never faster,\nnever slower, always coming.\n\nNow, tracking along a floor. Sprinkles of blood, streaks of\nit, like someone, terribly injured has been hauling\nthemselves along.\n\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n\n(V.O.)\n\nYou will run - it will walk. You\nwill rest - it will not.\n\nNow travelling along those corridors, picking out details.\n\nEvery now and then, incongruously, there is a television\nmonitor wired into the wall. Each of these is currently\nsnowed with interference.\n\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n\n(V.O.)\n\nOne day you will linger in the same\nplace too long.\n(MORE)\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\nBBC 2015 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL                             1\n\n\fDW9: \"Episode 11\" by Steven Moffat - BLUE Draft - 24/08/15.\n\n1\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n1\n\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n\nYou will sit too still or sleep too\ndeep - and when, too late, you rise\nto go, you will notice a second\nshadow next to yours. Your life\nwill then be over.\n\nNow on close on a section of wall. On closer inspection, a\ndoor.\n\nA crunching, grinding sound - and the wall section slides\naway revealing -\n\nCUT TO:\n\n2\n\nINT. TELEPORT CHAMBER/CASTLE - DAY\n\n2\n\nA circular chamber of ancient, but active, technology. Brass\nand glass. Intricate mechanisms, spinning and ticking and\nglittering everywhere. Again, dotted around the walls and\nequipment, cogs, this time in gleaming brass.\n\nCloser on:\n\nThe ceiling spirals down in towards the centre of the room,\nlike a funnel. Beneath the base of the funnel, a circular\nglass cabinet, just big enough for a man to stand in. It\nlooks like what it is: a teleporter.\n\nOn the teleporter controls.\n\nThe hunched shadow falls over it -\n\n- a trembling, bloodied hand reaches for a lever -\n\nThe room shakes, shudders!\n\nOn the wall - the brass cogs start glowing.\n\nThe bloodied hand slams the lever and the hunched figure\nfalls, crashing to the floor.\n\nIn the glass cabinet, a glow is starting up - exactly like\nthe glow we saw as the Doctor dematerialised at the end of\nTrap Street.\n\nOn the walls - the cogs turning.\n\nThe floor - the bloodied hand, shaking with effort, is\nwriting letters in the dust.\n\nB\n\nNow cutting round various walls of the castle -\n\n- the cogs turning and turning -\n\n- faster and faster -\n\nBack to the bloodied hand, writing in the dust -\n\nBBC 2015 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL                             2\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\fDW9: \"Episode 11\" by Steven Moffat - BLUE Draft - 24/08/15.\n\n2\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n2\n\nBIR\n\nThe glow in the cabinet, stronger and stronger. Starting to\ntake familiar shape -\n\nThe cogs - faster and faster.\n\nOn the bloodied hand still writing - we see curves and lines\nbut not the finished word.\n\nThe hand starts to glow. Spasms in pain - steaming now. In a\nmoment the hand crumbles to the barest outline of ash.\n\nOn the brass cogs. They all slam to a halt.\n\nCutting to the stone cogs on all the walls - also slamming to\na halt.\n\nNow on the glass cabinet at the centre of the chamber.\n\nThe golden glow is resolving, refining -\n\n- now clearly, this is the Doctor.\n\nHe is frozen for a moment -\n\n- then convulses into life. Choking, spluttering. Slams\nagainst the glass of the cabinet, starts to register where he\nis.\n\nA moment to recover.\n\nNow he’s opening the door of the cabinet, stepping into the\ngleaming brass and glass room. Looking around.\n\nA haunted look crosses his face. A memory impacting,\nsickeningly.\n\nFLASHBACK: Clara’s death from Trap Street.\n\nThe Doctor: she’s dead, she’s gone. Nothing he can do.\n\nSo. To business.\n\nHe glances round. A studied show of indifference to his\nsurroundings.\n\nStraightens his coat. Composes himself. If anyone is\nobserving, he’s telling them he means business and he is not\nafraid.\n\nFinally, he speaks.\n\nTHE DOCTOR\n\nIf you think, because she’s dead, I\nam weak, you understand very\nlittle. If you were any part of\nkilling her, and you are not\nafraid, you understand nothing at\nall. So for your own sake,\nunderstand this. I’m the Doctor.\n\n(MORE)\n\nBBC 2015 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL                             3\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\fDW9: \"Episode 11\" by Steven Moffat - BLUE Draft - 24/08/15.\n\n2\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n2\n\nTHE DOCTOR (cont'd)\n\nI am coming to find you. And I will\nnever, ever stop.\n\nHe moves to the door - stops. What’s he walking in? He\nkneels. The floor seems covered in some strange ashy\nsubstance - almost as if the floor itself were made of a\ncompacted version of it. It clearly piles up in the corners.\nHe runs the dust through his fingers. What is that? Doesn’t\nmatter. He dusts it from his hands, steps to the door. It\ngrinds open.\n\nHe steps out into:\n\n3\n\nINT. CIRCULAR CORRIDOR - DAY\n\nCUT TO:\n\n3\n\nA corridor encircles the circular chamber. Four corridors, at\nregular intervals, give off radially from this circle. They\nare labeled North, South, East and West. There are windows\ntoo. He’s clearly in a tower.\n\nThe Doctor steps to one of the windows.\n\nA very high tower - and encircled by another, much larger\nbuilding. Fifty feet away, a rearing gray cliff face of\nwindows. There are walkways connecting this tower to the\nsurrounding castle - these are the corridors we already saw.\n\nHe looks down. This building is huge, falls away into mist.\n\nHe looks up. The sky above is coppery - like a sunset.\n\nTHE DOCTOR\nThe equipment in that room is\nconsistent with an augmented, ultra\nlong range teleport. So I am not\nmore than a single light year from\nwhere I was and I am in the same\ntime zone.\n\n(Looks out the window)\n\nWhen the sun sets I’ll be able to\nestablish an exact position by the\nstars. Then you’ll have a choice.\nCome out and show yourself. Or keep\nhiding. Clara said I shouldn’t take\nrevenge. You should know, I don’t\nalways listen.\n\nHe notices something. Propped against the wall, a perfectly\nordinary garden spade. On the blade of it, there are traces\nof fresh soil. He rubs the soil between his fingers.\n\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n\nOh, are you gardeners? Never liked\ngardening. What sort of person has\na power complex about flowers -\nit’s dictatorship for inadequates.\nOr to put it another way - it’s\ndictatorship.\n\n(MORE)\n\nBBC 2015 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL                             4\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\fDW9: \"Episode 11\" by Steven Moffat - BLUE Draft - 24/08/15.\n\n3\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n3\n\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n(Tosses the spade, looks\n\naround)\n\nWell come on!

Show\nme what you’ve got! I just watched\nmy best friend die in agony - my\nday can’t get any worse. Let’s see\nwhat we can do about yours.\n\nNothing silence.\n\nTHE DOCTOR (cont’d)\n\nOh, don’t try to be mysterious, not\nwith me. I don’t even have a name,\nI’m automatically ahead.\n\nAs he turns, he notices something.\n\nWords inscribed on the wall behind him. Almost filling it,\nlike a page of writing.\n\nThe Doctor’s POV.\n\nPanning along the words, the first line reads:\n\nAs you come into this world\n\nOn the Doctor, reading those words, frowning. Behind him we\nsee one of the TV monitors flare into life.\n\nThe picture resolves into a POV shot of a corridor similar to\nthe one we are in.\n\nNow panning down the next line of words.\n\nsomething else is also born.\n\nOn the screen: the POV changing. As if standing up from a\nchair, now moving along the corridor ...\n\nPanning down the next line of words.\n\nYou begin your life and it begins a journey.\n\nOn the screen: the POV has moved towards one of the windows,\nnow looking out of it. Through the window we can see another\nwing of the same building, more windows.\n\nPanning down the next line:\n\nTowards you.\n\nOn the screen: a sudden, shaky zoom in on one of the windows.\nAnd we see the Doctor as he is right now! He’s caught in\nprofile, reading the words on the wall.\n\nSome instinct makes the Doctor turn -\n\n- and he sees his own image on the screen.\n\nWhat??\n\nHe quickly calculates which window he’s being filmed through,\nsteps towards it.\n\nBBC 2015 PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL                             5\n\n(CONTINUED)\n\n\fDW9: \"Episode 11\" by Steven Moffat - BLUE Draft - 24/08/15.\n\n3\n\nCONTINUED:\n\n3\n\nWe hold on the screen as the Doctor now appears fully at the\nwindow, staring right at the camera.\n\nThe Doctor’s POV.\n\nAt a window, directly opposite him, a slim, motionless white\nfigure is staring back at him.
