Again, dotted around the walls and\n      equipment, cogs, this time in gleaming brass.\n      Closer on:\n      The ceiling spirals down in towards the centre of the room,\n      like a funnel. Beneath the base of the funnel, a circular\n      glass cabinet, just big enough for a man to stand in.

Starting to\n      take familiar shape -\n      The cogs - faster and faster.\n      On the bloodied hand still writing - we see curves and lines\n      but not the finished word.\n      The hand starts to glow.

They all slam to a halt.\n      Cutting to the stone cogs on all the walls - also slamming to\n      a halt.\n      Now on the glass cabinet at the centre of the chamber.\n      The golden glow is resolving, refining -\n      - now clearly, this is the Doctor.\n      He is frozen for a moment -\n      - then convulses into life. Choking, spluttering. Slams\n      against the glass of the cabinet, starts to register where he\n      is.\n      A moment to recover.\n      Now he’s opening the door of the cabinet, stepping into the\n      gleaming brass and glass room. Looking around.\n      A haunted look crosses his face. A memory impacting,\n      sickeningly.\n      FLASHBACK: Clara’s death from Trap Street.\n      The Doctor: she’s dead, she’s gone. Nothing he can do.\n      So. To business.\n      He glances round. A studied show of indifference to his\n      surroundings.\n      Straightens his coat. Composes himself. If anyone is\n      observing, he’s telling them he means business and he is not\n      afraid.\n      Finally, he speaks.\n      THE DOCTOR\n      If you think, because she’s dead, I\n      am weak, you understand very\n      little. If you were any part of\n      killing her, and you are not\n      afraid, you understand nothing at\n      all. So for your own sake,\n      understand this.
