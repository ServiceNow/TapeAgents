More technically, it is the [semi\\-major axis](/wiki/Semi-major_axis \"Semi-major axis\") of the geocentric [lunar orbit](/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon \"Orbit of the Moon\"). The lunar distance is on average approximately 385,000 km (239,000 mi), or 1\\.28 [light\\-seconds](/wiki/Light-second \"Light-second\"); this is roughly 30 times [Earth's diameter](/wiki/Earth_radius \"Earth radius\") or 9\\.5 times [Earth's circumference](/wiki/Earth%27s_circumference \"Earth's circumference\"). Around 389 lunar distances make up an AU [astronomical unit](/wiki/Astronomical_unit \"Astronomical unit\") (roughly the distance from Earth to the Sun).\n\nLunar distance is commonly used to express the distance to [near\\-Earth object](/wiki/Near-Earth_object \"Near-Earth object\") encounters.[\\[1]](#cite_note-NEO-1) Lunar semi\\-major axis is an important astronomical datum; the few\\-millimeter precision of the range measurements determines semi\\-major axis to a few decimeters; it has implications for testing gravitational theories such as [general relativity](/wiki/General_relativity \"General relativity\") and [\\[2]](#cite_note-Relativity-2) and for refining other astronomical values, such as the [mass](/wiki/Earth_mass \"Earth mass\"),[\\[3]](#cite_note-moonbounce-3) [radius](/wiki/Earth_radius \"Earth radius\"),[\\[4]](#cite_note-Fischer-4) and [rotation](/wiki/Earth%27s_rotation \"Earth's rotation\") of Earth.[\\[5]](#cite_note-LLR-5) The measurement is also useful in expressing the [lunar radius](/wiki/Lunar_radius \"Lunar radius\"), as well as the [distance to the Sun](/wiki/Astronomical_unit \"Astronomical unit\").\n\nMillimeter\\-[precision](/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision \"Accuracy and precision\") measurements of the lunar distance are made by measuring the time taken for laser beam light to travel between stations on Earth and [retroreflectors](/wiki/Retroreflector \"Retroreflector\") placed on the Moon. The Moon is spiraling away from Earth at an average rate of 3\\.8 cm (1\\.5 in) per year, as detected by the [Lunar Laser Ranging experiment](/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment \"Lunar Laser Ranging experiment\").[\\[6]](#cite_note-drift1-6)[\\[7]](#cite_note-drift2-7)[\\[8]](#cite_note-drift3-8)\n\nValue\n-----\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lunar_distance&action=edit&section=1 \"Edit section: Value\")]\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a7/Moon%27s_orbit_-_Variation_of_distance_en.png/280px-Moon%27s_orbit_-_Variation_of_distance_en.png)](/wiki/File:Moon%27s_orbit_-_Variation_of_distance_en.png)\n\nVariation of the distance between the centers of the [Moon](/wiki/Moon \"Moon\") and the [Earth](/wiki/Earth \"Earth\") over 700 days\n\n[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/H%C3%A4ufigkeitsverteilung_von_79535_Perig%C3%A4en_und_Apog%C3%A4en.png/400px-H%C3%A4ufigkeitsverteilung_von_79535_Perig%C3%A4en_und_Apog%C3%A4en.png)](/wiki/File:H%C3%A4ufigkeitsverteilung_von_79535_Perig%C3%A4en_und_Apog%C3%A4en.png)\n\nDistribution of perigee and apogee between 3000 BC and AD 3000\n\nBecause of the influence of the Sun and other perturbations, the Moon's orbit around the Earth is not a precise ellipse. Nevertheless, different methods have been used to define a [semi\\-major axis](/wiki/Semi-major_and_semi-minor_axes \"Semi-major and semi-minor axes\"). [Ernest William Brown](/wiki/Ernest_William_Brown \"Ernest William Brown\") provided a formula for the [parallax](/wiki/Parallax \"Parallax\") of the Moon as viewed from opposite sides of the Earth, involving [trigonometric](/wiki/Trigonometric \"Trigonometric\") terms. This is equivalent to a formula for the inverse of the distance, and the average value of this is the inverse of 384,399 km (238,854 mi).[\\[9]](#cite_note-MeeusMorsels1Ch4-9)[\\[10]](#cite_note-:1-10) On the other hand, the time\\-averaged distance (rather than the inverse of the average inverse distance) between the centers of Earth and the Moon is 385,000\\.6 km (239,228\\.3 mi). One can also model the orbit as an ellipse that is constantly changing, and in this case one can find a formula for the semi\\-major axis, again involving trigonometric terms.

However, due to [its elliptical orbit](/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon \"Orbit of the Moon\") with varying eccentricity, the instantaneous distance varies with monthly periodicity. Furthermore, the distance is perturbed by the gravitational effects of various astronomical bodies – most significantly the Sun and less so Venus and Jupiter. Other forces responsible for minute perturbations are: gravitational attraction to other planets in the Solar System and to asteroids; tidal forces; and relativistic effects.[\\[23]](#cite_note-integration-23)[\\[24]](#cite_note-24) The effect of [radiation pressure](/wiki/Yarkovsky_effect \"Yarkovsky effect\") from the Sun contributes an amount of ±3\\.6 mm to the lunar distance.[\\[22]](#cite_note-APOLLO_Analysis-22)\n\nAlthough the instantaneous uncertainty is a few millimeters, the measured lunar distance can change by more than 30,000 km (19,000 mi) from the mean value throughout a typical month.

This would occur when the duration of the lunar orbital period equals the rotational period of Earth, which is estimated to be 47 Earth days. The two bodies would then be at equilibrium, and no further rotational energy would be exchanged. However, models predict that 50 billion years would be required to achieve this configuration,[\\[33]](#cite_note-tidal_lock-33) which is significantly longer than the [expected lifetime of the Solar System](/wiki/Red_giant#The_Sun_as_a_red_giant \"Red giant\").\n\n### Orbital history\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lunar_distance&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Orbital history\")]\nLaser measurements show that the average lunar distance is increasing, which implies that the Moon was closer in the past, and that Earth's days were shorter.

The space age marked a turning point when the precision of this value was much improved. During the 1950s and 1960s, there were experiments using radar, lasers, and spacecraft, conducted with the benefit of computer processing and modeling.[\\[36]](#cite_note-DE_102-36)\n\nSome historically significant or otherwise interesting methods of determining the lunar distance:\n\n### Parallax\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lunar_distance&action=edit&section=7 \"Edit section: Parallax\")]\nThe oldest method of determining the lunar distance involved measuring the angle between the Moon and a chosen reference point from multiple locations, simultaneously. The synchronization can be coordinated by making measurements at a pre\\-determined time, or during an event which is observable to all parties. Before accurate mechanical chronometers, the synchronization event was typically a [lunar eclipse](/wiki/Lunar_eclipse \"Lunar eclipse\"), or the moment when the Moon crossed the meridian (if the observers shared the same longitude). This measurement technique is known as [lunar parallax](/wiki/Parallax#Lunar_parallax \"Parallax\").\n\nFor increased accuracy, the measured angle can be adjusted to account for refraction and distortion of light passing through the atmosphere.\n\n#### Lunar eclipse\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lunar_distance&action=edit&section=8 \"Edit section: Lunar eclipse\")]\nEarly attempts to measure the distance to the Moon exploited observations of a lunar eclipse combined with knowledge of Earth's radius and an understanding that the Sun is much further than the Moon. By observing the geometry of a lunar eclipse, the lunar distance can be calculated using [trigonometry](/wiki/Trigonometry \"Trigonometry\").\n\nThe earliest accounts of attempts to measure the lunar distance using this technique were by Greek astronomer and mathematician [Aristarchus of Samos](/wiki/Aristarchus_of_Samos \"Aristarchus of Samos\") in the 4th century BC[\\[37]](#cite_note-Gutzwiller-37) and later by [Hipparchus](/wiki/Hipparchus \"Hipparchus\"), whose calculations produced a result of 59–67 R🜨 (376000–427000 km or 233000–265000 mi).[\\[38]](#cite_note-transit-38) This method later found its way into the work of [Ptolemy](/wiki/Ptolemy \"Ptolemy\"),[\\[39]](#cite_note-Measuring_the_Universe-39) who produced a result of 64\\+1⁄6 R🜨 (409000 km or 253000 mi) at its farthest point.[\\[40]](#cite_note-Helden-40)\n\n#### Meridian crossing\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lunar_distance&action=edit&section=9 \"Edit section: Meridian crossing\")]\nAn expedition by French astronomer [A.C.D.

Careful measurements from 1905 to 1910 measured the angle of elevation at the moment when a specific lunar crater ([Mösting A](/wiki/M%C3%B6sting_(crater) \"Mösting (crater)\")) crossed the local meridian, from stations at [Greenwich](/wiki/Greenwich \"Greenwich\") and at [Cape of Good Hope](/wiki/Cape_of_Good_Hope \"Cape of Good Hope\").[\\[41]](#cite_note-Commelin-41) A distance was calculated with an uncertainty of 30 km, and this remained the definitive lunar distance value for the next half century.\n\n#### Occultations\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lunar_distance&action=edit&section=10 \"Edit section: Occultations\")]\nBy recording the instant when the Moon [occults](/wiki/Occultation \"Occultation\") a background star, (or similarly, measuring the angle between the Moon and a background star at a predetermined moment) the lunar distance can be determined, as long as the measurements are taken from multiple locations of known separation.\n\nAstronomers [O'Keefe](/wiki/John_A._O%27Keefe_(astronomer) \"John A.

After the radio waves echoed off the surface of the Moon, the return signal was detected and the delay time measured. Multiple signals were added together to obtain a reliable signal by superimposing oscilloscope traces onto photographic film.

By measuring the [parallax](/wiki/Parallax \"Parallax\") between the Moon and the chosen background star, the lunar distance was calculated.[\\[49]](#cite_note-Citizen1-49)\n\nA more ambitious project called the \"Aristarchus Campaign\" was conducted during the [lunar eclipse](/wiki/Lunar_eclipse \"Lunar eclipse\") of 15 April 2014\\.[\\[21]](#cite_note-Zuluaga-21) During this event, participants were invited to record a series of five digital photographs from moonrise until [culmination](/wiki/Culmination \"Culmination\") (the point of greatest altitude).\n\nThe method took advantage of the fact that the Moon is actually closest to an observer when it is at its highest point in the sky, compared to when it is on the horizon. Although it appears that the Moon is biggest when it is near the horizon, the opposite is true. This phenomenon is known as the [Moon illusion](/wiki/Moon_illusion \"Moon illusion\"). The reason for the difference in distance is that the distance from the center of the Moon to the center of the Earth is nearly constant throughout the night, but an observer on the surface of Earth is actually 1 Earth radius from the center of Earth. This offset brings them closest to the Moon when it is overhead.\n\nModern cameras have achieved a resolution capable of capturing the Moon with enough precision to detect and measure this tiny variation in apparent size. The results of this experiment were calculated as LD \\= 60\\.51\\+3\\.91\n−4\\.19 R🜨. The accepted value for that night was 60\\.61 R🜨, which implied a 3% accuracy. The benefit of this method is that the only measuring equipment needed is a modern digital camera (equipped with an accurate clock, and a GPS receiver).\n\nOther experimental methods of measuring the lunar distance that can be performed by amateur astronomers involve:\n\n* Taking pictures of the Moon before it enters the [penumbra](/wiki/Umbra,_penumbra_and_antumbra \"Umbra, penumbra and antumbra\") and after it is completely eclipsed.\n* Measuring, as precisely as possible, the time of the eclipse contacts.\n* Taking good pictures of the partial eclipse when the shape and size of the Earth shadow are clearly visible.\n* Taking a picture of the Moon including, in the same field of view, [Spica](/wiki/Spica \"Spica\") and [Mars](/wiki/Mars \"Mars\") – from various locations.\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lunar_distance&action=edit&section=14 \"Edit section: See also\")]\n* [Astronomical unit](/wiki/Astronomical_unit \"Astronomical unit\")\n* [Ephemeris](/wiki/Ephemeris \"Ephemeris\")\n* [Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris](/wiki/Jet_Propulsion_Laboratory_Development_Ephemeris \"Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris\")\n* [Lunar Laser Ranging experiment](/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment \"Lunar Laser Ranging experiment\")\n* [Lunar theory](/wiki/Lunar_theory \"Lunar theory\")\n* [*On the Sizes and Distances* (Aristarchus)](/wiki/On_the_Sizes_and_Distances_(Aristarchus) \"On the Sizes and Distances (Aristarchus)\")\n* [Orbit of the Moon](/wiki/Orbit_of_the_Moon \"Orbit of the Moon\")\n* [*Prutenic Tables* of Erasmus Reinhold](/wiki/Prutenic_Tables \"Prutenic Tables\")\n* [Supermoon](/wiki/Supermoon \"Supermoon\")\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n\\[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lunar_distance&action=edit&section=15 \"Edit section: References\")]\n\n1. **[^](#cite_ref-NEO_1-0)** [\"NEO Earth Close Approaches\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20140307125729/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/). *Neo.jpl.nasa.gov*.

His pace is therefore 42,195 meters / 7260 seconds, which equals approximately 5.8 meters per second. The minimum perigee distance to the Moon is 356,352.93 km, or 356,352,930 meters. To find the time to cover this distance at Kipchoge's pace, divide the distance by the pace: 356,352,930 meters / 5.8 meters per second = 61,485,000 seconds. Converting seconds to hours gives 61,485,000 seconds / 3600 seconds per hour = 17,124 hours. Rounding to the nearest 1000 hours gives 17,000 hours."
