Although it appears that the Moon is biggest when it is near the horizon, the opposite is true. This phenomenon is known as the\n      BID:1371 link Moon illusion\n      . The reason for the difference in distance is that the distance from the center of the Moon to the center of the Earth is nearly constant throughout the night, but an observer on the surface of Earth is actually 1 Earth radius from the center of Earth. This offset brings them closest to the Moon when it is overhead.\n    \n      Modern cameras have achieved a resolution capable of capturing the Moon with enough precision to detect and measure this tiny variation in apparent size.
