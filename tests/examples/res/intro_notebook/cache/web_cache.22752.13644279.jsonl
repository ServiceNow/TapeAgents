The sale of assets included Vulcan's [chloralkali](/wiki/Chloralkali_process \"Chloralkali process\") plants in Wichita, Kansas; Geismar, Louisiana; and Port Edwards, Wisconsin, as well as Vulcan Chemicals' joint venture located in Geismar, Louisiana. In 2005, Vulcan acquired 11 aggregates operations and five asphalt plants in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana and Tennessee.\n\nOn February 19, 2007, Vulcan announced that it would buy stone and cement producer Florida Rock Industries for $4\\.7 billion.[\\[6]](#cite_note-6)[\\[7]](#cite_note-7) Vulcan completed the acquisition of Florida Rock on November 16, 2007\\.[\\[8]](#cite_note-8)\n\nIn March 2007, Vulcan announced that it had been named to [Fortune Magazine](/wiki/Fortune_Magazine \"Fortune Magazine\")'s list of *Most Admired Companies* for the sixth time. The company was ranked first in its industry sector, \"Building Materials, Glass.\" Overall, Vulcan ranked among the top 10 companies in the [Fortune 1000](/wiki/Fortune_1000 \"Fortune 1000\") for both long\\-term investment and [social responsibility](/wiki/Social_responsibility \"Social responsibility\").\n\nIn January 2014, Vulcan Materials announced they would be selling their Florida Rock Industry (cement and ready\\-mixed concrete) plants and equipment to [Cementos Argos](/wiki/Argos_S.A. \"Argos S.A.\"), of Colombia. In March 2014, Vulcan was able to fully divest these properties to Cementos Argos.[\\[9]](#cite_note-FloridaRockSale-9)\n\nIn January 2018, Vulcan Materials was found to be partially responsible for the [Bayou Corne sinkhole](/wiki/Bayou_Corne_sinkhole \"Bayou Corne sinkhole\"), along with [Occidental Petroleum](/wiki/Occidental_Petroleum \"Occidental Petroleum\") and Texas Brine Company.[\\[10]](#cite_note-10)\n\nIn June 2021, Vulcan Materials announced they would be acquiring [US Concrete (USCR)](/wiki/U.S._Concrete \"U.S. Concrete\") for $74 per share, a 30% premium on the date of the announcement. U.S. Concrete was formed in 1999, with its headquarters in Euless, TX. The deal is valued at $1\\.3 billion.
