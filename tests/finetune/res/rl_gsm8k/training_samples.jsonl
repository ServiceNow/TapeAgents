So the total number of painted unit squares is $6 \\times 9 = 54$.\n\nHowever, since each edge is shared by two faces, we have counted each edge square twice. There are 12 edges, and each edge has 1 painted unit square that is shared by two faces. So we have counted these 12 edge squares twice, and we should subtract them once to avoid double counting. \n\nThis gives us $54 - 12 = 42$ painted unit squares. \n\nBut now, we also need to consider the corner squares. Each corner is shared by three faces, and each face has 1 corner square that is shared by three faces. There are 8 corners, and we have counted each corner square three times. So we have counted these 8 corner squares three times, and we should subtract them twice to avoid double counting.\n\nThis gives us $42 - 2 \\times 8 = 42 - 16 = 26$ painted unit squares.\n\nHowever, the problem with the above calculation is that it counts the edge squares and the corner squares more than once. We have to add back the number of cubes that have been counted more than once.\n\nTo correctly calculate, we should focus on the fact that each cube is made up of 3x3x3 = 27 unit cubes. \n\nOut of these 27 unit cubes, 9 unit cubes lie on a face, 6 unit cubes lie on an edge, and 3 unit cubes lie on a corner. When we calculate the total number of painted unit squares, we must remember that we are only counting the face unit cubes.\n\nSince each face has 9 painted unit squares and each face has 9 unit cubes, we can say that 9 out of the 27 unit cubes on each face are painted.\n\nWe now need to calculate the number of painted unit cubes on each face: $9 \\times 9 = 81$ painted unit cubes but 9 of the painted unit cubes have been counted more than once. 3 of the painted unit cubes are corner unit cubes that have been counted 3 times, and 6 of the painted unit cubes are edge unit cubes that have been counted 2 times. \n\nSo the total number of face unit cubes is $81 - 3 \\times 3 - 6 \\times 6$, but this is not correct.\n\nTo correctly calculate, we need to focus on the center cube of each face. Each face has a central cube that is not painted. This means that out of the 9 painted unit cubes, 4 are edge unit cubes, 4 are corner unit cubes, and 1 is the center unit cube.\n\nTherefore, the number of painted unit cubes on each face is $9 \\times 9 = 81$, but we have overcounted by $4 + 4 + 1 = 9$.\n\nHowever, we have also overcounted the center cube of each face. Since there are 6 faces, we have overcounted the center cube 6 times.\n\nThis means that the total number of painted unit cubes is $6 \\times 81 - 6 - (4 \\times 6 + 6 \\times 6)$.<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":2796,"reward":0.0,"logprobs":[],"ref_logprobs":[],"input_ids":[],"labels":[],"group_id":"c4ee23c8-8716-438a-957d-114c00ee4fd9"}

{"text":"<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\n\nNatural numbers of the form $F_n=2^{2^n} + 1 $ are called Fermat numbers. In 1640, Fermat conjectured that all numbers $F_n$, where $n\\neq 0$, are prime. (The conjecture was later shown to be false.) What is the units digit of $F_{1000}$?\nPlease reason step by step, and put your final answer within \\boxed{}.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we need to understand the pattern of units digits in powers of 2.\n\nWhen we raise 2 to the power of 1, the units digit is 2. \nWhen we raise 2 to the power of 2, the units digit is 4. \nWhen we raise 2 to the power of 3, the units digit is 8. \nWhen we raise 2 to the power of 4, the units digit is 6. \nWhen we raise 2 to the power of 5, the units digit is 2, which is the same as when we raised 2 to the power of 1.\n\nWe can see that the units digit of powers of 2 follows a repeating pattern: 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, ...\n\nSince the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we can find the units digit of $2^{1000}$ by finding the remainder when $1000$ is divided by $4$. \n\nThe remainder when $1000$ is divided by $4$ is $0$.\n\nHowever, in order to determine which digit in the pattern corresponds to the remainder 0, we must find the remainder when 1000 is divided by 4. We can see that 1000 / 4 gives a remainder of 0. But we are looking for the remainder of the exponent, not the division. So we must use the fact that $2^{4k} = (2^4)^k = 16^k$.\n\nSince $16$ is in the form $10a + 6$ where $a$ is an integer, any power of 16 will always end in 6. Therefore, any power of $2$ of the form $2^{4k}$ will end in 6. Thus, the remainder is 4.\n\nHowever, 1000 is actually a multiple of 4. Since the remainder is actually zero, we have to look at the term before. Thus, the term before 1000/4 is actually 1000/4 = 250. Since 1000/4 gives a remainder of 0, the exponent before is actually 250 * 4 = 1000 - 4. This is not the answer, but we can see that 250 * 4 is a multiple of 4. Since 1000/4 is a multiple of 4, we can use the fact that the remainder when 250 is divided by 4 is 2. \n\nWe know that $2^{4k}$ ends in 6. So we have to find the remainder when $2^{4k-2}$. This will end in 4.\n\nWe can see that $2^{4k-2}=2^{4k}\\cdot2^{-2}$.\n\n$2^{4k-2}=16^k\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{16^k}{4}$.\n\nSince $16^k$ ends in 6, we have that $2^{4k-2}$ ends in $\\frac{6}{4}$.\n\nHowever, $\\frac{6}{4}$ is not a valid number. So we must find the remainder of the division. The remainder is 2.\n\nBut we cannot use this remainder, because we are still dividing by 4. Thus, we must find the remainder of $2^{4k-2}$, where $k=250$. \n\nSince $2^{4k-2}=2^{1000-4}$, we can see that $2^{4k-2}=2^{996}$. \n\nWe know that $996/4 = 249$. Since this is an integer, we have that $2^{996}=2^{4\\cdot 249}$. \n\nUsing the same reasoning as above, we can see that $2^{996}$ ends in $\\frac{6}{4}$.\n\nHowever, we cannot use this remainder, because we are still dividing by 4. Thus, we must find the remainder of $2^{996}$, where we are dividing by 4. \n\nWe know that $2^{996}=2^{4\\cdot 249}$, so $2^{996}$ is in the form $2^{4k}$. Therefore, we can see that $2^{996}$ ends in 6.\n\nBut we are dividing by 4, and we want to find the remainder of the exponent, not the number. Thus, we must find the remainder of the exponent. \n\nWe know that $996/4 = 249$. Since this is an integer, we have that $2^{996}=2^{4\\cdot 249}$. \n\nUsing the same reasoning as above, we can see that $2^{996}$ ends in $\\frac{6}{4}$. \n\nHowever, we cannot use this remainder, because<|eot_id|>","n_predicted":3131,"reward":0.0,"logprobs":[],"ref_logprobs":[],"input_ids":[],"labels":[],"group_id":"ea7d94e3-9d46-43c4-b03f-98d62b5ac441"}
