This means that the number of sales (S) is related to the cost (C) by the equation:\n\nS = k / C\n\nwhere k is a constant.\n\nWe are given that 12 customers buy a toaster that costs $500. We can use this information to find the value of k. \n\nS = k / C\n12 = k / 500\nk = 12 * 500\nk = 6000\n\nNow that we know the value of k, we can use it to find the number of customers who would buy a toaster that costs $750.\n\nS = k / C\nS = 6000 / 750\nS = 8\n\nTherefore, according to Daniel's theory, 8 customers would buy a toaster that costs $750.\n\nThe answer is:  \\boxed{8}"

This means that the corresponding angles formed by these lines are supplementary.\n\nStep 2:  We are given that $\\angle A = 2\\angle D$ and $\\angle C = 3\\angle B$. Since $\\overline{AB}$ and $\\overline{CD}$ are parallel, we can say that $\\angle A + \\angle D = 180^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle C + \\angle B = 180^{\\circ}$.\n\nStep 3:  Using the given relationship $\\angle A = 2\\angle D$, we can substitute $2\\angle D$ for $\\angle A$ in the equation $\\angle A + \\angle D = 180^{\\circ}$, resulting in $2\\angle D + \\angle D = 180^{\\circ}$.\n\nStep 4:  Solving this equation, we get $3\\angle D = 180^{\\circ}$.\n\nStep 5:  Dividing both sides by 3, we find that $\\angle D = 60^{\\circ}$.\n\nStep 6:  Since $\\angle A = 2\\angle D$, we can substitute the value of $\\angle D$ into this equation, giving us $\\angle A = 2(60^{\\circ})$.\n\nStep 7:  Therefore, we have $\\angle A = 120^{\\circ}$.\n\nSo, the final answer is $\\boxed{120}$."

The probability of this sub-case is also 5/36.\n\nThe total probability of Case 2 is the sum of the probabilities of the two sub-cases: 5/36 + 5/36 = 10/36 = 5/18.\n\n**Case 3: Two 1's obtained**\n\nIn this case, we are interested in the outcome where both dice show a 1. There is only one outcome that satisfies this condition. The probability of this case is 1/36.\n\nNow, we need to find the expected number of 1's obtained. We can do this by multiplying the probability of each case by the number of 1's obtained in that case and then summing the results.\n\nExpected number of 1's = (Probability of Case 1 * 0) + (Probability of Case 2 * 1) + (Probability of Case 3 * 2)\nExpected number of 1's = (25/36 * 0) + (5/18 * 1) + (1/36 * 2)\nExpected number of 1's = 0 + (5/18) + (1/18)\nExpected number of 1's = (5 + 1) / 18\nExpected number of 1's = 6/18\nExpected number of 1's = 1/3\n\nSo, the expected number of 1's obtained when two standard dice are rolled is 1/3.\n\n\\boxed{1/3}"

We can see that 1000 / 4 gives a remainder of 0. But we are looking for the remainder of the exponent, not the division. So we must use the fact that $2^{4k} = (2^4)^k = 16^k$.\n\nSince $16$ is in the form $10a + 6$ where $a$ is an integer, any power of 16 will always end in 6. Therefore, any power of $2$ of the form $2^{4k}$ will end in 6. Thus, the remainder is 4.\n\nHowever, 1000 is actually a multiple of 4. Since the remainder is actually zero, we have to look at the term before. Thus, the term before 1000/4 is actually 1000/4 = 250. Since 1000/4 gives a remainder of 0, the exponent before is actually 250 * 4 = 1000 - 4. This is not the answer, but we can see that 250 * 4 is a multiple of 4. Since 1000/4 is a multiple of 4, we can use the fact that the remainder when 250 is divided by 4 is 2. \n\nWe know that $2^{4k}$ ends in 6. So we have to find the remainder when $2^{4k-2}$. This will end in 4.\n\nWe can see that $2^{4k-2}=2^{4k}\\cdot2^{-2}$.\n\n$2^{4k-2}=16^k\\cdot\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{16^k}{4}$.\n\nSince $16^k$ ends in 6, we have that $2^{4k-2}$ ends in $\\frac{6}{4}$.\n\nHowever, $\\frac{6}{4}$ is not a valid number. So we must find the remainder of the division. The remainder is 2.\n\nBut we cannot use this remainder, because we are still dividing by 4. Thus, we must find the remainder of $2^{4k-2}$, where $k=250$. \n\nSince $2^{4k-2}=2^{1000-4}$, we can see that $2^{4k-2}=2^{996}$. \n\nWe know that $996/4 = 249$. Since this is an integer, we have that $2^{996}=2^{4\\cdot 249}$. \n\nUsing the same reasoning as above, we can see that $2^{996}$ ends in $\\frac{6}{4}$.\n\nHowever, we cannot use this remainder, because we are still dividing by 4. Thus, we must find the remainder of $2^{996}$, where we are dividing by 4. \n\nWe know that $2^{996}=2^{4\\cdot 249}$, so $2^{996}$ is in the form $2^{4k}$. Therefore, we can see that $2^{996}$ ends in 6.\n\nBut we are dividing by 4, and we want to find the remainder of the exponent, not the number. Thus, we must find the remainder of the exponent. \n\nWe know that $996/4 = 249$.

                "reasoning": "To find the units digit of $F_{1000}$, we need to understand the pattern of units digits in powers of 2.\n\nWhen we raise 2 to the power of 1, the units digit is 2. \nWhen we raise 2 to the power of 2, the units digit is 4. \nWhen we raise 2 to the power of 3, the units digit is 8. \nWhen we raise 2 to the power of 4, the units digit is 6. \nWhen we raise 2 to the power of 5, the units digit is 2, which is the same as when we raised 2 to the power of 1.\n\nWe can see that the units digit of powers of 2 follows a repeating pattern: 2, 4, 8, 6, 2, 4, 8, 6, ...\n\nSince the pattern repeats every 4 powers, we can find the units digit of $2^{1000}$ by finding the remainder when $1000$ is divided by $4$. \n\nThe remainder when $1000$ is divided by $4$ is $0$.\n\nHowever, in order to determine which digit in the pattern corresponds to the remainder 0, we must find the remainder when 1000 is divided by 4. We can see that 1000 / 4 gives a remainder of 0. But we are looking for the remainder of the exponent, not the division. So we must use the fact that $2^{4k} = (2^4)^k = 16^k$.\n\nSince $16$ is in the form $10a + 6$ where $a$ is an integer, any power of 16 will always end in 6. Therefore, any power of $2$ of the form $2^{4k}$ will end in 6. Thus, the remainder is 4.\n\nHowever, 1000 is actually a multiple of 4. Since the remainder is actually zero, we have to look at the term before. Thus, the term before 1000/4 is actually 1000/4 = 250.
