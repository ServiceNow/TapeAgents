    "**TapeAgents** is a framework that leverages a structured, replayable log (**Tape**) of the agent session to facilitate all stages of the LLM Agent development lifecycle. In TapeAgents, the agent reasons by processing the tape and the LLM output to produce new thoughts, actions, control flow steps and append them to the tape. The environment then reacts to the agent’s actions by likewise appending observation steps to the tape.\n",

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVIDIA’s stock outlook for 2024, 2025, and the next decade. Join us as we explore detailed insights into the company’s financial performance, strategic initiatives, and potential in new markets like autonomous driving and the Internet of Things (IoT).\\n\\nNVIDIA’s Recent Price History\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nNVIDIA Corporation, founded in 1993, went public in 1999 with an initial share price of $12\\\\. Note that, adjusted for the multiple splits NVDA has undergone, this is equivalent to $0\\\\.4375—we’ll refer to the split\\\\-adjusted price from here.\\n\\nThe company quickly made a name for itself in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, and its stock saw steady growth through the early 2000s.\\n\\nIndicative pricing only\\n\\n### Early 2000s to 2015: Building the Foundation\\n\\nThroughout the 2000s, NVIDIA expanded its product line, targeting both gaming and professional markets. Significant milestones included the release of the GeForce 256 in 1999, often considered the world's first GPU.\\n\\nThe company's stock price rallied in the dot\\\\-com bubble, cresting $6 in 2001\\\\. After sinking to a low of $0\\\\.60 in 2002, NVDA began a long uptrend, peaking at $9\\\\.92 in 2007, just before the 2008 financial crisis sent it plummeting back to $1\\\\.44\\\\. Continuing to expand its presence in the GPU arena over the years, NVIDIA’s stock rebounded, closing 2015 at $8\\\\.24\\\\.\\n\\n### 2016\\\\-2017: The Boom Begins\\n\\nThe period from 2016 onwards marked a dramatic shift for NVIDIA. Driven by the increasing demand for GPUs in gaming, data centres, and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA's stock price began to soar.\\n\\nBy mid\\\\-2016, NVIDIA had introduced the Pascal architecture, which significantly improved performance and efficiency. This innovation, coupled with strong financial results, saw the stock price surge to a high of $29\\\\.98 by the end of 2016, while by the end of 2017, the stock had been trading near $50\\\\.\\n\\n### 2018\\\\-2020: Volatility and Growth\\n\\nIn 2018, NVIDIA’s stock experienced volatility due to a slowdown in cryptocurrency mining, which had previously driven GPU sales. The stock price peaked at around $73\\\\.19 in October 2018 but closed the year at $33\\\\.38\\\\. Despite this, NVIDIA's long\\\\-term prospects remained strong, bolstered by continued advancements in AI and data centre applications. By early 2020, the stock price had rebounded to above $70\\\\.\\n\\n### 2020\\\\-Present: Surging Ahead\\n\\nWhile the COVID\\\\-19 pandemic caused a brief blip in NVDA’s price, the event actually further accelerated demand for NVIDIA’s products as more people turned to gaming and remote work. NVIDIA's willingness to acquire Arm Holdings in September 2020 for $40 billion highlighted its strategic expansion.\\n\\nThe stock price broke the $125 mark in mid\\\\-2020, closing 2021 at $294\\\\.11\\\\. While rising interest rates and restrictive financial conditions drove NVDA lower in 2022, to a low of $108\\\\.13, the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022 and the resulting surge in AI adoption marked a watershed moment for NVIDIA.\\n\\nNVIDIA quickly became one of the world’s most valuable companies in 2023 thanks to exploding demand for its products. In May 2023, it crossed the $1 trillion market cap threshold and peaked at $502\\\\.66 in August.\\n\\nNVIDIA continues to dominate the GPU and AI computing space in 2024, recently reaching an all\\\\-time high of $974 in March 2024\\\\. Notably, it almost reached a $2 trillion market cap faster than both Microsoft and Apple. NVDA is currently worth around $950 at the time of writing in late May.\\n\\nWant to keep up to date with the latest NVDA price movements?

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of NVIDIA’s stock outlook for 2024, 2025, and the next decade. Join us as we explore detailed insights into the company’s financial performance, strategic initiatives, and potential in new markets like autonomous driving and the Internet of Things (IoT).\\n\\nNVIDIA’s Recent Price History\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nNVIDIA Corporation, founded in 1993, went public in 1999 with an initial share price of $12\\\\. Note that, adjusted for the multiple splits NVDA has undergone, this is equivalent to $0\\\\.4375—we’ll refer to the split\\\\-adjusted price from here.\\n\\nThe company quickly made a name for itself in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market, and its stock saw steady growth through the early 2000s.\\n\\nIndicative pricing only\\n\\n### Early 2000s to 2015: Building the Foundation\\n\\nThroughout the 2000s, NVIDIA expanded its product line, targeting both gaming and professional markets. Significant milestones included the release of the GeForce 256 in 1999, often considered the world's first GPU.\\n\\nThe company's stock price rallied in the dot\\\\-com bubble, cresting $6 in 2001\\\\. After sinking to a low of $0\\\\.60 in 2002, NVDA began a long uptrend, peaking at $9\\\\.92 in 2007, just before the 2008 financial crisis sent it plummeting back to $1\\\\.44\\\\. Continuing to expand its presence in the GPU arena over the years, NVIDIA’s stock rebounded, closing 2015 at $8\\\\.24\\\\.\\n\\n### 2016\\\\-2017: The Boom Begins\\n\\nThe period from 2016 onwards marked a dramatic shift for NVIDIA. Driven by the increasing demand for GPUs in gaming, data centres, and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA's stock price began to soar.\\n\\nBy mid\\\\-2016, NVIDIA had introduced the Pascal architecture, which significantly improved performance and efficiency. This innovation, coupled with strong financial results, saw the stock price surge to a high of $29\\\\.98 by the end of 2016, while by the end of 2017, the stock had been trading near $50\\\\.\\n\\n### 2018\\\\-2020: Volatility and Growth\\n\\nIn 2018, NVIDIA’s stock experienced volatility due to a slowdown in cryptocurrency mining, which had previously driven GPU sales. The stock price peaked at around $73\\\\.19 in October 2018 but closed the year at $33\\\\.38\\\\. Despite this, NVIDIA's long\\\\-term prospects remained strong, bolstered by continued advancements in AI and data centre applications. By early 2020, the stock price had rebounded to above $70\\\\.\\n\\n### 2020\\\\-Present: Surging Ahead\\n\\nWhile the COVID\\\\-19 pandemic caused a brief blip in NVDA’s price, the event actually further accelerated demand for NVIDIA’s products as more people turned to gaming and remote work. NVIDIA's willingness to acquire Arm Holdings in September 2020 for $40 billion highlighted its strategic expansion.\\n\\nThe stock price broke the $125 mark in mid\\\\-2020, closing 2021 at $294\\\\.11\\\\. While rising interest rates and restrictive financial conditions drove NVDA lower in 2022, to a low of $108\\\\.13, the debut of ChatGPT in late 2022 and the resulting surge in AI adoption marked a watershed moment for NVIDIA.\\n\\nNVIDIA quickly became one of the world’s most valuable companies in 2023 thanks to exploding demand for its products. In May 2023, it crossed the $1 trillion market cap threshold and peaked at $502\\\\.66 in August.\\n\\nNVIDIA continues to dominate the GPU and AI computing space in 2024, recently reaching an all\\\\-time high of $974 in March 2024\\\\. Notably, it almost reached a $2 trillion market cap faster than both Microsoft and Apple. NVDA is currently worth around $950 at the time of writing in late May.\\n\\nWant to keep up to date with the latest NVDA price movements?

This growth was largely fueled by the data centre segment, which saw a 409% YoY increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of the 2024 fiscal year, underscoring the rising demand for AI\\\\-driven technologies\\u200b.\\n\\nIn 2024, NVIDIA aims to continue its trajectory by focusing on expanding its AI ecosystem. Key initiatives include the development of new AI chips and the expansion of its software and services portfolio.

Projections suggest that NVIDIA could achieve $100 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, providing ample resources for strategic acquisitions and further R\\\\&D investments\\u200b.\\n\\nAnalytical NVIDIA Price Prediction for 2024\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nNVIDIA's target prices in 2024 remain elevated, driven by several key factors. Analysts project strong growth due to the relentless demand for AI technologies, which NVIDIA is well\\\\-positioned to capitalise on.\\n\\nThe company's financial performance in 2023 laid a solid foundation, with significant gains in revenue and net income, particularly in the data centre segment. NVIDIA's Q3 2023 results showed a three\\\\-fold increase in data centre revenue year\\\\-over\\\\-year, reaching $14\\\\.51 billion\\u200b\\u200b.\\n\\nAnalysts emphasise that NVIDIA's stock is not just about hardware sales but the entire AI ecosystem it has built. This comprehensive approach is expected to drive substantial recurring revenue, bolstering the company's financial stability and growth prospects.\\n\\nDespite a 230%\\\\+ gain in 2023, NVIDIA's fundamentals have improved, supporting the stock's valuation. The company's earnings per share (EPS) forecasts for fiscal 2024 have increased, reflecting growing investor confidence.\\n\\nMoreover, NVIDIA's strategic investments in AI and data centre technologies are anticipated to yield significant returns. The ongoing integration of AI capabilities in various sectors presents a long runway for growth. Companies are increasingly adopting NVIDIA's AI solutions to enhance productivity and operational efficiency, further driving demand for NVIDIA's products.\\n\\nOverall, NVIDIA's robust position in the AI market, combined with its strategic initiatives and strong financial performance, is seen as likely to push NVDA to its price targets in 2024\\\\.\\n\\n### NVIDIA Stock Prediction for 2024\\n\\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/jqXH60zwKr288NOIKHMgGcAMEfIPbDeQPIbrMDyOW2HSo2yz_gj1z-1jXPu3ib-E3GFazesg8eZlrcSOYlLPe705trsPxkinIpBFvodeEqT5L9UGBxG88VZPJF-uyHgMJpbPX8GKNy8N_ISxDhCs2Xs)Mid\\\\-Year 2024:\\n\\n* Most Bullish Projection: 1179\\\\.74 (StockScan)\\n* Most Bearish Projection: 993\\\\.57 (WalletInvestor)\\n\\nEnd\\\\-of\\\\-Year 2024:\\n\\n* Most Bullish Projection: 2493\\\\.52 (StockScan)\\n* Most Bearish Projection: 1235\\\\.89 (WalletInvestor)\\n\\nAnalytical NVDA Stock Forecast for 2025\\n---------------------------------------\\n\\nAnalysts have high expectations for NVIDIA stock price targets in 2025, driven by strong financial performance and strategic growth initiatives. Analysts forecast NVIDIA's full\\\\-year revenue to reach approximately $111\\\\.3 billion in 2025, a significant increase from the $26\\\\.97 billion reported in 2023\\\\. Earnings per share (EPS) are projected to rise correspondingly, reflecting the company's continued profitability and operational efficiency.\\n\\n### AI and Data Center Dominance\\n\\nNVIDIA's leadership in AI and data centre technologies is a key driver of its stock performance.

The company's strong free cash flow provides the financial flexibility to pursue acquisitions that can enhance its technological capabilities and market reach. This strategic approach is anticipated to support long\\\\-term growth and sustain its competitive edge\\u200b.\\n\\n### Market Sentiment and Analyst Upgrades\\n\\nMarket sentiment towards NVIDIA remains positive, with numerous analyst upgrades reflecting confidence in the company's growth prospects. Despite some concerns about overvaluation, the consensus is that NVIDIA's strong fundamentals and leading position in key technological areas justify its high stock price. The stock's performance in 2025 is expected to take advantage of continued innovation and execution of its strategic initiatives\\u200b.\\n\\n### NVIDIA Stock Prediction 2025\\n\\n![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/y9wdbJ9FGfC4XjJyUWY1E1mEMngiPBNUhO2Mz15o1Q3dvLCkLJiqbUlIDOzXREUUTJtbobqM1dLwIXLcxWLUBFuWuJfIgIh2I6YvpgrEpflBqdjILnmrr19sTZjXYknV5L5hRELZqEUrOHl9-XI1big)Mid\\\\-Year 2025:\\n\\n* Most Bullish Projection: 3827\\\\.17 (StockScan)\\n* Most Bearish Projection: 1364\\\\.44 (Traders Union)\\n\\nEnd\\\\-of\\\\-Year 2025:\\n\\n* Most Bullish Projection: 5219\\\\.46 (StockScan)\\n* Most Bearish Projection: 1484\\\\.36 (Traders Union)\\n\\nAnalytical NVIDIA Stock Price Forecast for 2026 to 2030 and Beyond\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNVIDIA is expected to maintain its technological leadership and expand its market presence from 2026 to 2030\\\\.
